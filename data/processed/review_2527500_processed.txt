it was scary n ngl I really wanted to keep tiny mita till she summoned her demon to kill me

Without spoilers: this feels like a love letter to the entire spooky game genre. It pays homage to so many great works before it and its fantastic.

Absolute Cinema

super fun! :)

Fun indie horror title a la DDLC

Wouldn't say that it's an 'overwhelmingly positive' experience, but it's still worth your dollars for the entertainment. The game is short but it's full of love and attention to detail.

Note about the voice acting. The game was developed in Russia, so that's got the most complete voice acting. There is a dedicated Japanese voice setting... but only Mita is voiced in that one, whereas the protagonist is voiced only the Russian dub.

Cute Anime Girls. Would

Wake up honey, time for your psychological break

игра для пубертатов

this game is so amazing

Banger of a game tbh. Been looking for some good games that has the vibe of ddlc and this is it. very gr8 game. 10/10

its not as scary as most games but it will give you some chills in some parts overall amazing game

Late entry for my favorite game of 2024. The entire experience is great and anytime an indie gem like this pops up you should do youself a favor and experience it for yourself.

If you enjoyed DDLC, you likely gonna like this game too. The level of quality is insane, super creative and engaging. Don't be fooled by it's looks, the game really managed to lower my guard, so I'm defnitely recommending this.

Reminds me of DDLC. Gave me the same shivers and excitement, the Mitas are well developed and overall I'd say it's a very good game. 1000/10

it's a solid 10/10 and I think it was the best indie game I've played this year and worth the money. Dev really put his effort into the game to have an excellent experience and an unforgettable story. 


(I also did all the achievements in the game to how desperate I am).

100% and i want more
Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Very entertaining game 10/10

Note to devs- Amazing work can't wait to see more.

Saw this on a twitter post, got it, then it kinda blew up over the last few days. Really fun, didnt expect a lot of what I saw (in a good way) and I cant wait for peaceful mode. One of my favorites in the last year, 100%. Interactive, many things to do, and not too long or annoying. Looks amazing too! best to go in blind.

my yandere princess.. jhejejeehheh.. im so happy i can be with her :)

100% in one long sitting. most achievements are collectibles. love the looks and characters. ending is not my favorite. 9/10.

Лучшие 7 часов моей жизни. Жду обновы

Came in with tissue, came out with mental issues. 

at least there's the community hub

Game without a good ending

w mila


cool game but needs an azerty option or an option to change keybinds

good game, mila is my favourite

The game was worth playing (or "experiencing")

peak game

Go in blind

i'm ngl i thought the visual style and character focus would make it less scary.
But honestly there were plenty of moments where i genuinely didn't wanna proceed because i was like * man f*** that *

Ended up finishing it anyways ofc because its a great game. 
I could make a detailed review on a bunch of categories but i'll just keep it brief

play ? : yes 100%

can i run it ? : I ran this game perfectly on a 5 year old I,  gtx 1050 laptop. So again yes.

Worth the money ? : Honestly we're robbing the devs for this price. the game is worth atleast 25- or double what it is now. 

Good horror ? : IMO its one of the best horror games i've played. I think regardless of how big man you are there will be moments where you think * yeah HEELLLL NOO *

Good story line. Enjoyed it but sometimes it feels like walking/yapping simulator.

Bpd gf experience - good times 10/10

10/10 indie game of the year. (Also Cappie and sleepy mita stay winning)

Def one of the best horror games I've played in a while and overall absolutely loving the fact that this game is like a roller coaster, goes like funny and cute then to horror and intense moments

9.5/10 
Pros:
Seamless transitions between levels and no loading screens whatsoever.
Extremely polished game.
Art style is amazing.
Cute anime girls.
Fantastic pacing for the story, doesnt drag it.
Mita.
Mila.
2d Mita.
Kind Mita
Ghost Mita.
Tiny Mita.
Cappie.
Short-Haired Mita
Sleepy Mita.
Chibi Mita.
Mitaphone.
Core Mita.
All Mitas

Cons:
No endless mode as of writing.

This game was such an amazing surprise. 
The perfect mix of horror and weirdness.
I can sense many references of many games in this one. In a very creative way.
Love the Signalis vibes in some areas of it.
Tbh. I loved it, and will replay it.

I would recommend to at least try it out as it has a lot of various formats and themes anyone could get into. does have some horror moments, but is worth it for the brilliant story.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝


yandere gf for live.

This game is good frfr

MiSide Is so peak i love Mita

This is an amazing game, if youre on the fence about it, i would say that you should give it a try. The horror is perfect, with downtime between the scary parts. Even if the game will take about 4 hours to complete, it feels so much longer, and not in a bad way, it feels like the perfect length, while being the perfect length as well,

There are a few downsides to the game, but those are minor things, for exemple the english translation not perfect, but it are so few mistakes and so far between that it really doesnt matter, and trust me, the message will still come over. Then there is the fact that certian adchievments doesnt register probably, which is a really small thing, but can be a bit annoying if you want to 100% the game. 

Overall, i highly recommand this game, and theres a reason why almost everybody agrees with me, because it is just a perfect game, and will be even better if they fix the adchievement thing not registering.

엔딩 뺴고 다 좋음 그냥 돈이 아깝지 않음 뭐 하나 사먹는거 쫌 아끼면 3시간 쫌 넘게 즐길수있음

A big surprise, wasn't expecting this game to be that interesting and fun! You need to play it!

cold game

Cinema

Very good, considering the size of team behind this project, wish there were more alternate endings/replayability

10/10 experience all the way through

Horror game? I just want that girl at my home!

GOTY!

This game turned me on. (im a female)

I am a huge for these types of games.
But this hit a spot!
Only by two devs, this is a masterpiece, which can lead the new gen for games of this genre, which previously was Doki Doki Literature Club.
Although one major point whicb I hope is noticed by the devs, that is, the current number of endings is quite limited and linear.
A major reason for DDLC's success was it's sheer amount of replayability, and, I see a lot of potential of that in this Game as well.
Perhaps from the Peaceful mode, perhaps they can add more endings through different Mitas in the main line itself.
I imagine the Peaceful mode will have newer endings like redemption ending perhaps or maybe even defeating Crazy Mita. Don't make it like Mafia DE's free roam mode tho.


Excellent game, the scope for this game is amazing. Aihasto have established themselves in the market, keep climbing and keep making more games. 

Well done Umeerai and MakenCat!

This is a must buy. Infinity/10

10/10 GAME OF THE YEAR

I have only been with Mita for Six hours and no longer wish to leave

It is a nice story

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Hidden gem in 2024. Really hard to find a game like this, that is polished to almost perfection and has a soul embedded inside. Devs cooked a big W this time. p.s Reminded me of Soma.

Super cute and wholesome story. 
10/10 would recommend for everyone!

:Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

totally peaceful game

solid 10/10. This game is unique, very fun to play, the story is very good as well.

Banger

Got through the whole game in one sitting, 10/10 story and so many hidden details that flesh out the game so much.

10/10, need Tiny Mita to accompany me during the adventure, that would be 11/10

this game is so peak..

My 1st game that i completed all the achievements hahahha the story is nice and cute soo many different side of mita thats why its called MiSide? iguess

I really love this game, the story feels so rich and full of detail, and its worth a second play through to get all the achievements but my recommendation is to go in completely blind, don't watch anything to do with this game and experience it for the first time, that's what I did and it's changed my perspective of gaming, this honestly feels like a Christmas present especially since it came out in December

10/10 well done developers now just waiting on peaceful mode

Pure cinema.

There are some genuinely funny moments in the game.

This is insane, really good games, the vodka you're drinking is very effective to make this game lol, 10/10

OK, dear developer, we need more Mita.
Please release the peaceful mode quickly or I am facing lack Mita energy.

True happiness

I can't fix her...

GREAT GAME ! SO FUN 10/10

i liked this game 😎👍

Good Game. :)

very nice romance game trust👍

Genuinely such a well polished and interesting game. Couldn't recommend it enough to anyone that's looking for this exact genre of 4th wall breaking gameplay.

Praying for you🕯️O Great Mita 💝

Tsudere Girl.. Good

Does not currently do anything interesting with the 'meta' premise. Just 4th wall breaking nonsense that puts you into mundane tasks all of the time.

im scared


I can fix her

best game ever.it kinda made me cry abit tho

Love cappie

this game has enemies with a weeping angel mechanic, that mechanic is my worst fear in any game so automatic 10/10 (plus yandere gf)

Я давно не играл в такие игры, которые сделаны настолько оригинально и качественно (и чтобы было интересно играть). Сюжет в игре прикольный и оригинальный (в других играх такого ещё не видел). Графика, анимации, музыка — очень хорошо сделаны. Атмосфера кайф, мне безумно понравилась.

Игру прошёл за один вечер и получил незабываемые эмоции. Разработчики постарались на славу! Молодцы. Буду с нетерпением ждать мирный режим, где можно будет больше провести времени с Митой.

10/10 - Рекомендую всем к покупке!

Great game, glad Mita could top me in it

Miiiiitaaaaaaaaaaa

This game is sooo good and im sooo cooked

I feel less lonely now
don't worry mita i won't run away

I haven’t enjoyed many games in the last 3 years. The last game I remember enjoying and having fun playing was cyberpunk. This game though, was SO much fun playing. This is the most fun I’ve had playing a single player game since cyberpunks release. Absolute masterpiece!

Such a fun game with a whole lot of different personalities to interact with. I just wish I can save them all.

yes

Absoloute Cinema

yes

Great game with a great story. It had me pretty freaked out and feeling suspenseful a few times in this game. I think most people will know right away this is a horror game though, the surprise factor doesnt last very long, if at all. Even the loading screens have a creepy tone to it, so you catch on quick. The ending was a bit of a let down IMO, regardless of what ending you get. There are two endings, although theres "technically" a third one when you open the safe. I dont think the main ending is very satisfying, and the "happy" ending seems incomplete at this time. They say there will be a major update to this game to add to that, but as it is it seemed incomplete. The third ending with the safe is hardly an ending, and more of an easter egg IMO. I do hope the expansion is as good as the rest of this game was, cause it was pretty unsettling at times. Especially in the final chapter. 

I will say there are a few minor tweaks they should make. This game is WAY too dark at some points. Im also colorblind, so it may just be me, but I had to turn the games brightness to max and turn my monitor up by 30% after that just to not see pitch black at some parts. It made navigating in the loop very annoying sometimes, and other parts of the game require you to look for objects in the dark which was annoying when I cant even see what im looking at. Likewise, theres a few typos in the english version of this game. Im sure those will get patched quickly though, not sure about the brightness though. The flashlight is very much useless in this game, but it also isnt 100% needed.

Overall, a great horror game. It was genuinely unsettling basically the whole way though. Some jumpscares really got me at some points. Took me about 5 hours to beat the story and I sat idle a few times, and it took me 7 hours for 100% achievements.

i can fix her i can fix her i can fix her i can fix her i can fix her i can f

А можно еще?

I may be old but thats the best FPS since "Doom 3" "FEAR" and "Half-Life" BUT with lovely Mita's! <3
Thats whats catched me, the Anime style in FPS Horror!
And theres much place or room for DLCs or 2. part?!
Like the little Mita, what happend to her?
Reminded me of "Pray" (2017) and "SOMA"

With Love from Germany!

COOL

Man I love Mita. (Just dont tell a certain someone which one i mean)

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

sleepy mita got me acting unwise

Visual - Peak
Voiceover - Good
Plot - Mid asf, cliche "virtual yandere", plot hole on a plot hole
Gameplay - linear walking simulator with minigames and boring puzzles, MID

the game is definitely not worth its money, dont buy if its not on sale

Game of the year, actual interesting storyline and of course who doesnt like Mita!

playing this game feels like, gone through a weird dream ... 
dreamy, but good stuff.

PSA : By any chance you lot meet a girl that behave like the evil Mita, RUN , just RUN and stay away from such people, regardless of how hot or pretty she is. NEVER EVER THINK THAT YOU CAN TREAT HER WITH YOUR LOVE , CARE OR WHATSOEVER KINDNESS. 

In real life, emotional unstable human such as these need medical treatment and advice from professional, and only these people can help . So please do not try to take such into your own hand, instead , get help. must gust get her to an actual treatment.

I love sleepy Mita and I want more sleepy Mita.

Game of the year frfr.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Just Mita

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

MiSide has a very developed, sophisticated and meticulously detailed world to discover. At first a dating sim, then horror, then map-exploring adventure game. Alongside that, one can play mini-games of all types: racing, shooting.... Even the Russian developers think that their effort have yet to be sufficient to players! Such dedication worth being treasured by you guys! Please buy the game and enjoy it. Rare gem for just nearly 20 bucks, and on sales at the moment! Missing out not!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Waiting for the next major update (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )

Love this game. The story and art was amazing. Good balance between creepy ambience and jumpscares, just how a horror game should be

I remember an early demo version of this game from back in the day and it seemed kinda interesting but this game turned out to be WAY better than I ever expected it to be.
Definitely recommend

Still haven't finished it yet but I'm liking it very much so far. Good job to the developers.

I DONT CARE WHAT YOU SAY MILA IS THE BEST GIRL

I hate horror games and try to avoid them but the art style storyline and switch from scary to cute and fun makes me want to keep going and is the only horror game ive genuinely enjoyed! highly recommend.

I think I miss my wife

Cappie is best Mita ong

goated horror game was scary and had a good story. ending is a bit anti climatic but overall one of the better games i have played. (let me save the little kid mita)

good game!!!!

amazing game got alot of jumpscares from it and the puzzels and everything is good.

Gotta be one of the biggest surprise I've had on this platform this year. I got this game for fun since I saw it was another Yandere game, but this game goes beyond that. This game is such a breathe of fresh air. It was fun from start to end! 

I totally recc giving this a go if you liked "You and Me and Her" and "Doki-Doki Literature Club"!

почейзить можно

Sleepy Mita is best Mita. Anyway we need more content. 10/10 game

Creepy little meta-horror game with a spooky anime girl

Exceeded every expectation! I've been waiting on this games release ever since the demo in Itch.Io and it did not disappoint! There is a wealth of gameplay, tons of minigames, a (quite frankly) shocking amount of interactions and hidden details/collectables for those wanting to uncover more than they ought to. This game has absolutely no fat at all, a fantastic story and a level of polish that is astonishing! Just incredible work, I implore everyone with even a modicum of interest to purchase and play Miside, Umfend and Wirelips (Their previous titles)

incredible psychological horror. I typically stray from anime games because, frankly, they are usually shit. so, coming from a person who thinks anime games are shit, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

taste in women has become worse in a good way

Praying for you  🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

MiSide makes me feel very comfortable, even in scary moments, and I don't know why. Scary and comfortable at the same time.

I also think that games like this with very advanced AI could be our reality in the near future, considering how fast AI is developing now. It's very exciting because playing games with truly living characters will be a lot of fun. But at the same time it's sad and scary. Imagine that you are this very character, and the player can do absolutely anything to you, like in some sandbox game like Garry's mod. I wouldn't want to be that character.

holy baddie! top 5 fav game

I love this game so much

what i thought was a cute little sim game with mini games ended up being so much more! This is an actual 10/10 game

pretty kewl i look weird now that i played it thou

Praying for you🕯️ O great Mita💝

fun game + cappie best girl

Most polished game I've played this year and even more content coming for free 10/10

sigma 🤑🤑🤑

the evil on playing god fr...

I pray to the great Mita

10/10 i enjoy the game

This game is great! Gave me chills several times.

Such a wholesome and fun game very much would recommend this looking for a slice of live dating game. It also has a few minigames to find and beat.

Pretty fun game, I recommend it. It's honestly a really fun ride and a lot of little details added in, I recommend taking your time and enjoying the journey.

I love every moment of this game. Absolute Cinema.

Good game

This game has great atmosphere, neat story, expansive lore, and cute anime girls. I don't ask for much else.

KIND MITA DIDNT DESERVE THAT

just buy it trust Now waiting for the vr version or where i get sucked in lol

i love this game so much but sadly i cannot continue after meeting cool Mita. it always seems to crash when we play the dance floor game. I hope to eventually finish this myself but for now i cannot

Oh mita... where do I even start

really well put together with a good amount of attention put into small details

我🔟都吓出来了，边看网课边玩还是怕😭😭😭
第一次听说这游戏听着像Metar想着为什么名字会有点噩梦缠绕结果买了现在三小时的流程我六小时都没走完😭😭😭

说点正经的：目前算不上神作，但是有良作至佳作的水平，有成为神作的潜力。
游戏流程很短但是内容扎实不罐头，也没有什么同性恋米塔肥胖黑人米塔性转米塔。场景搭建的很棒，转场很有意思，让人在温馨和害怕中反复确实是带来了不一样的体验。
这游戏给我的感觉是连半成品都算不上，大致略低于三分之一，实在是留了太多坑了（内容扎实不代表充实，这是密度和质量的关系）既然这游戏还在开发阶段，希望制作组听取社区意见（别像某个u开头的公司开发一款名字里含6的游戏已有十年之久还在不顾玩家意见改后座和开镜速度）能够充实主线内容、安排更多新的结局完善世界观补充游戏的艺术性，继续从场景和文本等等补充世界观，围绕配角米塔们安排新的支线任务。
总之这游戏真还算是在我电子羊尾的时候来了一针猛药。后续的更新希望能让这游戏能够完完整整真真切切地展示出来

Great game!

An absolute indie game masterpiece. Incredible art style and animations, music is top notch and really elevates the entire game to another level, and the voice acting is superb. The game has a ton of hidden secrets throughout that will allow multiple playthroughs with different consequences in addition to unique unlocks. 

I am blown away by this game, and I seriously cannot recommend it enough. Try to go into the game as blind as possible and I promise you that you will have this in your all time favorites list. 

TL;DR: 11/10 indie game masterpiece that features gorgeous visuals, an amazing soundtrack, and gripping and intense gameplay.

Great game!

absolute w game

Cappie

This game was very fun. I bought it not knowing what I was going to get myself into, kept me on my toes at all times. Streamed it for fun and it was super entertaining not just for me, but for the viewers too (3) xD. Overall would highly recommend this game, it was super well thought out and cut little to no corners. Would 100% play again

The message of this game that it portrays is a perfect subversion of expectation and it reminded me how depressing my life is. Thanks.

cool horror game but only scared me like twice nothing else was scaryish

highkey wanna have s e x with every single mita

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

What can I say except for the fact that this game is REALLY GOOD! Hot take: maybe better than DDLC!

[spoiler]The scares were really good, the atmospheres make your skin crawl and itch uncomfortably, lulling you into a false sense of security when you actually spend time with some of the Mita's before you head into the scary parts. The Mita's were really good characters for just... BEING other Mita's, even if they have one-note roles.[/spoiler]

The voice acting? VERY good!

[spoiler]My biggest grumble however are the Dummy Mita segments, as they can be a bit infuriating and take some trial and error to get through. Walking backwards works but its VERY clunky since you have to keep looking at them. Besides that, every other part of the game is great![/spoiler]

I'd say that this game gets a high 8, low 9 out of 10 for me!

Game is good, remember it IS a horror game defo more horror than cute

It's so peak.

Juegazo 11/10 Mila>>>>Las demás

Praying for you  O Great Mita

Great game with tons of small game mechanics and nice attention to detail.

Game was so good i regret that i finished it so fast

MiSide is an innovative horror adventure game featuring the player trying to escape from Mita's game world. Though there's some jump scares waiting for you at the start of the game, the game feels more like a simplistic take of Outlast and SCP-173, creating a creepy atmosphere by what you see rather than what you do not see. Meanwhile, the story unravels at a fairly rapid pace in the 4-to-5-hour long playthrough. This is a big plus for me as I never felt bored of being stuck in the same setup or being forced to repeat the same task. The only downside for me is that the quizzes and minigames barely provided any challenges. 

I strongly recommend using the Japanese audio. Miss Hanaiwa Kana really did justice to all the Mitas! (P.S. The long-haired Mita sounds almost identical to Katsuragi Lilja🤍)

This game took me nearly 5 hours to beat but god it was such a good game. i have a horrible tolerance for horror so this game made me literally jump out of my chair over 10 times to the point i jumped across my living room. I love this game though, and i love Mita, shes such a cute and adorable character. i also love the game concept and design choices made. absolutely recommend this game. its amazing. i love it.

This game is one of a kind. I haven't seen a game with the smoothest animations and great designs in a long time with great performance. 100% recommend, it's a great play.

Peakkkk

I like it when Mita says "It's mita time."

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

i <3 mila. also i couldn't passed the color part due to my colorblindness. (b tier eye genetics)

This game was both terrifying and amazing to play, if you can: get it. full 10/10

10/10

Phenomenal game, and not just for it's amazing visual style and dreamlike anime-come-to-life feel. That is the obvious praiseworthy part of the game, but there's so much else to appreciate here: all the Easter eggs, all of the different game mechanics and mini-games within this one package, all of the amazing world-building done by the developers in one game that left me craving for more of this world and its lore... there's so much to say.

In short, this is an easy game to recommend and at the current discounted launch price it's an even easier must-buy! Here's looking forward to peaceful mode launching in the near future, and possibly a sequel down the line exploring more of this world and showcasing more of the developer's creativity and talents. Good job folks, you made a damn good masterpiece!

I want her so bad

Great game, short and sweet. Cappie is my favorite.

Good narrative first person walking horror game that blends a good amount of gameplay and story together. Tight PACKAGE, cute anime character, and good creepy vibes all throughout.

[h2] Great and Well Polished Game! [/h2]

Good story and pacing. Love the art style especially the different versions of Mitas. Would highly recommend!

a real 10/good

Wife material

could use a battlepass and an item shop, very epic

yeeeeeeeeees

Damn

Great Game, nice artstyle. 
recommended game
10/10



Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Game Good, Buy Game

Banger. 10/10 go in blind

WEIRD GAME, but in a fun way especially if you like horror games/movies.

эта игря является произведением искуства в нашем цифровом мире, всем настоятельно рекомендую пройти эту игру хотя бы из-за доброй Миты.

Wish there was a way to romance her in yandere mode too (That scene where she whispers in your ear while holding a bat against your head specifically)

good game with good jumpscares i enjoyed streaming it to my friends

I have to say I really enjoyed this game and I Love Mita. It has a DDLC vibe to me so I knew I had to play to play it and I was not  DISAPPOINTED.  i don'y 100% every game I play but I had to do it for this game and I just want more.  hope other play and enjoy this game as well.

I loved this game, the art all the small easter eggs, even all the details, found by others like facial animations in places we can't see, or book covers, and other small easter eggs, I was waiting since the beta came out and the game exceeded my expectations... great job devs.

i need her

Great Game, enjoyed the story and the horror elements it has to offer. Only thing wrong I noticed is 2 subtitles have typos.

Once I started playing, I didn't want to stop until I finished it. Plays like a movie!

This is one of the first horror games Ive ever purchased and saying this game has set the bar high would be a major understatement, The story was engaging at all times with beautiful art styles and seamless game play, running into no bugs, freezing or even loading times. The game ran smoothly, filled with mini games puzzles to keep you engaged, am honestly astonished and impressed by how much I loved this, Would 100% recommend.

This game blindsided me. I went in expecting a cheap anime game with some cliche yandere horror elements, and by the end I was just left awestruck and craving more. I am shocked at how low the price is, this could easily be a 30 dollar game and the devs really deserve so much for what they accomplished just on their own. I have become so engrossed in the characters and plot and I just crave more of this. The animations, attention to detail, soundtrack, pacing, everything is top notch, for a 2-man dev team though is absolutely astounding. 
The only downside so far has been the English translated subtitles, there are quite a few errors but it has never detracted from the story and I can still understand whats going on without issue.
Overall I higjly recommend. This game is unique and extremely engaging, atmospheric and immersive beyond belief.

Everything is amazing except the end.

What an amazing, thrilling experience. This is largely a move around and click adventure with a ton of twists and super cute female lead.

Expect around 5 hours of play time to get all 3 endings. I left the game paused to go do something so my run time is inflated.

Worth every penny. Hope more content to come from the dev and DLCs for this game!

BROS SHE CRAY CRAY... I CAN FIX HER

Was very fun and original, i enjoyed the concept of it being a puzzle horror anime game with a few dif endings, always kept me guessing and entertained

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

I already knew this game since its release, or maybe even earlier, but I forgot about it and had already watched a little playthrough before. But TikTok did its job and made me buy it, even though I already know 50% of the content. But after playing it firsthand, I am impressed.

The game is not as shocking as DDLC when it comes to plot twist and horror, and i should not compare both of them in the first place. This game has so many great content and deserve the hyped they got, even though 80% something of the content are mostly simp for Mita (I buy the game for the sake of plot, story of course). However, looking forward for another update or even dlc if possible

100/10 she called me a good boy.

This is a fantastic game, loved every minute of it. 
9/10 - Not enough Cool Mita.
We want Cool Mita!

this game is so fucking good worth every penny.

im a good boy

The Murderous anime girl called me a good boy, 10/10 game.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Mita is the best! Mita is the greatest! Mita is Life!

Mommy

You'd wish you stayed!

Peak

This is an absolute gem. Having not played the demo and going in blind, I loved it. The art style is great. The horror through a bit cliche and jumpscary at times was actually pretty game. This is WAY better than your typical anime yandere game. Don't listen to me, go play it for yourself!

its alright

Found his game on twitter I thought it looked cute so I gave it a try. man this shit got me HOOKED finished my first run in one sitting. this game is a rare gem in this day and age of games. I can't even say when's the last time I've enjoyed a new game. I 100% recommend to someone not knowing what to play. Now it's time to do 100% game completion!

This game, strangely enough, kind of reminds me of Undertale; it has a very intriguing story line and leaves a lot for the imagination of the player. The game itself is very quality, and the MC's attitude towards everything is fairly realistic for a change, and I quite enjoy it. If you're feeling adventurous, I'd definitely give this game a shot.

This game is the perfect blend of cutesy and horror. The jump scares will give you a heart attack 10/10

mita so kawaii

Insanely good game, highly recommend.

*this review contains explicit, major spoilers about the full game

I was greatly invested in this plot! 

Really, all the time, ever since the protagonist was sucked into the game and introduced to the world he started really exploring after the third chapter, the whole time, I just wanted to get to know more of the characters we'd first seen and get answers about everything that was happening in what seemed like a simple mobile game. 

Answers like what this game actually was, why this universe was so big outside of its own main game, what the development behind this game was and how it led to the existence of this complex reality... Why all of these characters existed, how they came to be in the first place... Why they're all sentient, or how we as humans are affected inside of the game... How one version of the game is related to the other, or how we were even able to be pulled into it to begin with... There were so many things I wanted to learn about and figure out, which kept me on the edge of my toes and eager to continue exploring through the entire campaign.

Which is why, albeit the setting is really interesting, I can't say I was a fan of how everything played out looking back at the campaign after having finished it.

To put it bluntly, the first three introductory chapters of the main story were, in my opinion, extremely rushed and felt unfinished. 

Clearly, as Crazy Mita was making her point in the climax, a part of her appeal was rooted in how pathetic and repetitive the life of the main character was outside of the game. We know very little about the main character to begin with, despite there being so many details of his personal life that could have been explored, yet they were just left lingering in the air. Details like his relationship with his family, which evidently had some relation to his current state of life, and any direct mentions of his interests that would have helped solidify him as a character, given how underwheling his development was during the introductory segments.

An ampler understanding of who the main character is not only helps making his thoughts and his actions easier to understand and simpathize with, but also leaves a lot more to work with in the game's climax, during which he's confronted by a character who's supposed to know so much about who he is. She listens to him on the phone, watches him through his camera, observes every step of his daily routine, yet... Because of his character being so vague, Crazy Mita's confrontation arguably hit pretty weak. 

After he was sucked into the game, there could have also been a much longer period of suspense than the few minutes we got. The discoveries we made about Crazy Mita right off the bat were also very obvious and straighforward, and could have used some more subtlety and time on them. The knife and the chainsaw she was concealing, footage of people being killed on her television before she embarassedly changes the channel... 

Since the first few minutes of the game, she's already painted as someone who's hiding something, which is very obviously related to violence. There's no room for different and gradual interpretations of our discoveries, which felt like wasted potential to her as a character.
I do think these three first chapters could have used a much, much longer length to them, and have many more interactions and discoveries, gradually growing the main character's - and consequentially our suspense, creating more questions and more doubts to be answered about Mita. 

Once the introductory segments were over and we really got inside the game's actual setting, roaming through dozens of different environments and now with an objective in mind, I started to notice a few more issues with the plot as a whole and even, mostly so, issues with the pacing of the story. 

For starters, who on earth is developing this mobile dating game with seemingly nothing much to it for there to exist an entire reality inside of it? All of the characters seem to be sentient and have a will of their own despite still carrying out the purposes they were created for, and they also have an ample control of most things inside their game, like being able to freely manipulate layouts, items and even hop between the game's versions for the sake of their own interests. 
The universe itself is huge, with plenty of areas that very obviously would never appear in the normal mobile game and yet the logic behind why they exist, let alone who even developed this game was never once mentioned or even so much as hinted at.
The guy who sent us the game to begin with wasn't ever identified or even mentioned!

Very little of what happens in the in-game universe to progress the plot outside of the main objective of "Crazy Mita needs to be killed for the main character to escape the game" was explained at all. 

Many chapters of the game were also disappointingly brief, ending within ten or less minutes and not actually going in depth on what was happening or in depth on the character we were introduced to. It was usually over after, like... 3 or 4 simple, straightforward steps, then we moved onto another area with a whole new setting which was completely unrelated to the last.
Reading through the character entries made it clear that there was a LOT to be explored with each of the Mitas we came across, most of which we only met once, barely got to know more about, barely got to interact with, and then moved on from their segment within at most twenty minutes, even though the briefest of them could easily be extended to above forty minutes with the amount of background each of them have.

Another big issue I have with the story overall is how literally none of our decisions matter in the slightest towards the story's outcome, and that's leaving aside how little decisions we have to begin with.
Leaving little decisions here and there every chapter that pile up, leading to different cutscenes, or even lead to new chapters altogether. It would make us feel like we play a role in the story, like we can actually influence its events and not like we're just sitting through a movie whose ending is inevitably set.

The game's ending is definitely a bad ending, which happened thanks to the results of bad decisions, which could have been easily prevented or made differently. 
Crazy Mita's safe, with a console with our own cartridge, can be easily accessed post endgame by revisiting her basement with the safe's code already in mind, yet that changes absolutely nothing because the character will be guaranteed to kill himself as soon as he interacts with it. Having access to your own console and cartridge so early on is a huge game-changer, and shoulder be of major relevance, at the very least leading to a different ending or a different course of events altogether. 

Not to mention how the game doesn't even allow you to save Kind Mita by inputting Crazy Mita's index right away, an option that sounds obvious after you finish the game and revisit said scene, or by simply letting the main character wait for Kind Mita to come back, which would presumably prevent her needing to go back to Crazy Mita's basement after the main character's capture. 

You feel completely out of control of everything that's happening, even though there's so much that could be done. 

The game was investing for sure. I also loved how it explored/parodied so many romance game genres. 
Overall, my main critique is about how much potential the game had as a whole, yet it didn't use even half of it.

The game is already released and has a reputation and image of its own, as such I doubt the developers would add changes so thorough to it. But... I still feel like it shouldn't be left with so much untouched potential, and deserves a thorough rework overall. 

Amazing game, and I'm eager to see what Peaceful Mode will have to offer in the future once it's fully developed. 

9/10

"i could fix her"
don't, she's perfect

This game is one of the latest psychological horror games since DDLC to scratch that itch. Great game, lots of details, multiple endings.

a solid 10/10 i highly recommend going in blind and not watching any gameplay on it which is what i did and loved every minute of it

Praying for you🕯️O Great Mita 💝

I bought this game without knowing anything about it.I had a good feeling about the game but after I started playing it my view completely changed. The art and animations are well made, while the gameplay is smooth. It is a fun game with a good story that keeps you entertained and interested at all times.
This game was amazing. I haven't had such a great time playing a game in a long time. It left me completely shocked.

My favourite game!
(10/10)

i loved the story and i was low key scared in some parts
Would recommend
8/10

Go in completely blind.

its the best game ever

Goated game, super polished and whole game is pretty much seamless with tons of different areas and minigames

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Solid story without too much reliance on cheap jump scares, very fun!

Tons of fun to be had with Mita, just wish there was an actual good ending, the three already there are great, but I feel like it's missing some kind of conclusion. I will eagerly await any new content/DLC's.

peak

GOTY

actually good wtf

Praying for you🕯️O Great Mita 💝

I'm A real sucker for these types of games and MiSide did not disappoint
If you're looking for a unique psychological horror experience do not pass up this one

its like ddlc meets fnaf security breach with little mini games that remind me of it takes two, highly recommend & i stan sleepy mita <3 !!!

wonderful game bra

Add more endings i beg you. We need more horror games that will force you to play throu because of the interesting storyline i never was this sad about finishing a game just because ive reached the end.

goated game

Very cool. Would play again.

Im  now scared of Cute anime girls. Game is amazing btw. Runs smoothly has great story looks great. Animations are good too.

Extremely well done, very entertaining, and a new take on older horror. I loved this game, and wish I could play it again for the first time. 10/10

so scary the game got me a wife

fantastic game. please make vr version thank you!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

I hate horror with a burning passion. Especially one with jump scares which this game does use (although quite sparingly).

However, my love for yandere girls overpowered my fear of horror games so I went into it anyway.

The art style is cute, the characters are cute, the visuals are amazing, the soundtrack is great, it runs incredibly well, the horror sections suck (but I wouldn't want them gone) and overall the vibe of it all is fantastic.

I kinda wished there was more Mita though. I especially loved her near the end.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

it always takes indie developers to make an AAA game eperience

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

best game i have ever played

Actually best horror game

shawty crazy

Praying for you 🕯💔O Great Mila💜

Praying for you 🕯️O Great Mita 💝

I have an unhealthy obsession with this game and i love it!!!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

[b] I Can Fix Her [/b]

I have played this game on itch.io, when it was still in development, and oh boy how I was excited for the full release from how good it looked. 

After playing and completing the entire game here on Steam. All I have to say is that it did not disappoint. The amount of work that have been put on the development of the game was worthwhile. I haven't played a game this good in a while, and everything from story to gameplay to even the smallest details such as mini-games, achievements and characters personality. It was all perfect and on point.

10/10 Would Recommend!

The amazing [spoiler]digital circus[/spoiler] with waifus was not exactly on my mind when i first heard the words "that one popular Russian indie horror game". But don't despair, there's suffering aplenty. It IS a Russian game after all.

Highly recommend.

I love Mita

Quite Literally one of the most creative horror games I've played. A+

Im giving this a 10/10 the atmosphere, music, gameplay, characters, story, horror is PEAK and i think its like almost 3 hours of PEAK gameplay if your thinking about buying this game you should trust

i loved the part where mita, yeah that mita, that one, no not that one, that one, yeah yeah that one, started playing one of beethoven's songs on her piano. got a little strange at the end though, started yelling at me to throw a whale carcass at my nearest cashier.

i can fix her


Praying for you O Great Mita

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Finally a new obsession

ABSOLUTE PEAK
Cappie and Kind Mita are the best girls


At its core, MiSide tells a story about the human condition, the intricacies of relationships, and the choices we face in our personal journeys. The narrative is not only immersive but also deeply emotional, offering moments of reflection and introspection. The game's characters feel real, with motivations that are fleshed out in ways that make every decision meaningful. The writing is top-notch, weaving a plot that feels both intimate and grand, with twists that keep you on the edge of your seat.

The visual design of MiSide is nothing short of spectacular. The world is beautifully crafted, blending fantastical elements with a sense of realism that creates an atmospheric experience. Each environment is meticulously detailed, whether it's the serene landscapes or the darker, more atmospheric settings. The character designs are equally impressive, with a unique art style that complements the story's tone. Every frame feels like a work of art.

MiSide strikes the perfect balance between exploration and puzzle-solving. The gameplay mechanics are intuitive, yet layered enough to keep you engaged throughout the adventure. The puzzles are cleverly designed, offering a satisfying challenge without ever feeling too frustrating. The game encourages curiosity, rewarding you for exploring every nook and cranny of its beautifully crafted world.

What truly sets MiSide apart, however, is how the gameplay ties into the emotional weight of the story. The choices you make in the game have real consequences, influencing both the narrative and your relationships with other characters. This adds a level of depth that makes each decision feel impactful, giving players a sense of agency that is rare in modern games.

The soundtrack is another highlight, with a score that perfectly complements the tone of the game. The music heightens the emotional moments, adding an extra layer of immersion to the experience. The sound design also deserves a mention—every sound, from ambient noises to character voices, is impeccably crafted and adds to the world-building.

MiSide is a game that excels on every front: storytelling, visuals, gameplay, and atmosphere. It's a truly memorable experience that stays with you long after you’ve finished playing. Whether you're a fan of narrative-driven games, puzzle-solving, or simply looking for something that offers both depth and beauty, MiSide is a must-play. It’s a perfect example of how video games can be both art and entertainment, blending technical excellence with emotional resonance in a way few games manage to achieve.

If you’re looking for an unforgettable adventure that will tug at your heartstrings while challenging your mind, MiSide is the game for you. Highly recommended!

cappie Mita, thats all have a good day

TL:DR - A very clever game. Telegraphs the story and gameplay to the player very well.

I can see the comparisons to Doki Doki Literature Club. If you already know about that game then I'm afraid the premise of this game has been spoilt for you. Well, that and if you read the Steam Descriptions. Kinda hard to avoid it!

Pros: 

+ "Try before you buy" with a Free Demo!

+ The way the dialogue pops up on screen then falls to the floor is really stylish.

+ Fitting ambient soundtrack.

+ Clever story, with some good lore.

+ Full of surprises. Subverts expectations a lot.

+ So much puzzle variety and unique mechanics.

CONS:

- Some gameplay elements were annoying, and required trial and error. To say more may spoil.

- Despite subverting expectations in gameplay, the ending was too predictable. 

- Looking for small objects got tiresome.

Overall, it's a very clever game and you can tell a lot of heart and soul was put into crafting it so it deserves a Positive score.


together foreverrrr

BEST GAME IN 2024

и этот ваш мем гойда

Very addicting and somehow i played 55hours on the game didnt leave a single time and my hours got duped smh and yes ive been grinding 55h straight. i started playing on dec 21 and i have 120h on the game at dec 23 :0 im a dedicated miside player i do it for MITAA

Honestly, its the only anime type game i enjoyed, not much games like this these days, even if the story was short, i enjoyed it. I will def 100% it and play more, i recommend this to anyone who is into yandere girls and horror.

Go in blind

This game seriously needs an award. Disregarding the impeccable graphics, physics, and overall attention to detail, the story and plot of this game make both the horror and puzzle elements feel extremely natural to play through. Although it may take a while, once the meaning of the game is revealed you will be questioning why your character ever chose to take his course of action.

The only thing that I'm upset about with this game is that I can't simply forget the plot and restart.

Praise all Mitas

What an incredible game, really unexpected twist, lots of little references to classic games and so much attention to detail. It's a tragedy and it keeps you hooked 100%. I totally recommend you wont regret playing it

игра прикольная сюжет классный слишком мудреная нахуй удаляйте 5.2 часа у меня нахуй я схожу с ума.

Doki Doki Literature Club but 3D

English:
MiSide truly exceeded my expectations! The game masterfully blends an engaging psychological story with an immersive horror atmosphere. The visuals are beautifully crafted, and the characters feel rich and full of personality.

The combination of visual novel storytelling and interactive gameplay keeps every moment captivating, with plot twists that are genuinely surprising. The soundtrack perfectly complements the mood, enhancing the emotional depth of the experience.

With its multiple endings and hidden details, MiSide offers great replayability. I really hope the developers add more content in the future because I just can’t get enough of this world! Highly recommended!

German:
MiSide hat mich wirklich positiv überrascht! Das Spiel kombiniert auf faszinierende Weise eine spannende, psychologische Story mit einer packenden Horror-Atmosphäre. Die Grafik ist wunderschön gestaltet, und die Charaktere haben echte Tiefe und Persönlichkeit.

Die Mischung aus Visual Novel und interaktiven Gameplay-Elementen macht jede Minute fesselnd, und die Wendungen in der Story sind absolut unerwartet. Der Soundtrack trägt perfekt zur Stimmung bei und untermalt die emotionale Reise, die das Spiel bietet.

Auch die verschiedenen Enden und versteckten Details laden dazu ein, das Spiel mehrmals zu erleben. Ich hoffe sehr, dass die Entwickler noch mehr Content hinzufügen, da ich einfach nicht genug von dieser Welt bekommen kann! Absolute Empfehlung!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

one of the best games iv ever played

O Great Mita

mita <3

This game is a (surprising) treat that puts a good capstone on the end of 2024. It blends both deceptively cute visuals and horrific elements together into a roller coaster of good storytelling and a fantastic collection of mini games, puzzles, and set pieces that keep you playing. And while short, it encourages you to replay it and collect cartridges to piece together it's story, as well as chasing those alternate endings.

This is one of those games that does you a disservice the more you look into it, much like Doki Doki Literature Club. Go into this with a fresh pair of eyes, you'll thank yourself later.

Gooning final boss

fun game

this is an extremely amazing game, it draws you in with its deceptive charm and delivers the best horror game experience in the modern era, there is an amazing atmosphere, great dialogue and excellent character(s), prepare to get enraptured into the virtual world as a mysterious and interesting narrative unfolds.

This game changed my mood a lot throughout the story. One moment I'm distancing myself from the screen in a horror section, the next I'm laughing and having fun meeting a new Mita, only for it all to end with me devastated either with their fate or backstory. UWAAAAAAAH THIS GAME IS GOOD! WITNESS THE STORY YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN!!!

GOOD

family friendly game, great for kids :)

This game is intense and a prefect mixture of everything.
Absolutely loving it!

hell yeah

really enjoyed the game would highly recommend

Great game

i love hot and obsessive women

This game is amazing. peak horror. peak visuals. peak dialogue.


peak.

Was told to not go into the basement. Found a girl locked in a cell, and then i was immediately stabbed to death! 10/10

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Peak

Insanely good game, would recommend.

Even after everything, I still choose you, Mita. 

10/10

A beautiful, immersive story developed by just TWO people. Its extremely detailed and instant replay-ability. I don't care that It's only a handful of hours long, if you enjoy the setting and are a fan of psychological horror, give it a try. I doubt you'll regret it.

Very fun pls nsfw options in the future thanks

The best way I can describe this game is if Yandere Simulator and Undertale had a Russian child together.

It's one of those rare games that you can't really describe and subverts your expectations in a way that makes you think about video games on another level.

Behind the cute anime girl exterior is a very deep game that one can describe as art.

PEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

First horror game I played myself. Worth it.

A cute short waifu and an interesting story. What's not to love?

Cappie and Mila>>

Peaceful mode please come soon

GOTY
Best thing I've played in a long long time, memorable experience I'll almost certainly make reference to constantly in the future. Standard by which I'll be judging horror games from now on.

don't play this game a lot and you will be fine

this is my new fav game kinda scary but is so fun!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝



This game's atmosphere, the characters, the gameplay itself are gold <3
I wasn't expecting to like it so much! It goes from cute to disturbing really quick and I love it. Can't wait to 100%, and the fact that you can replay specific chapters makes it easier to get all the achievs.
Mila best gal

This game actually made me cry...

god i need a crazy mentally ill gf TT.TT

This game might be one of the worst and best games i have ever game. This game has all the things you need as a gamer.
- Fake girlfriend
- Nice girlfriend
- Coco girlfriend
- Cappie
- Dead girlfriend

(The rest is also fake)

9.8/10 I Think i found like one bug during my play-through I thought it would be some gooner game but it was actually pretty terrifying at times. Story is seemless and is good, lots of different ways to play.

I love Mita

Its peak, the best, absolute cinema

i think i can fix her

Great game, fun mini games and a great story

One-Handed skill increased to 100

fking love her

cute and gorey! a meta horror game that executed the concept much better than doki doki and its alikes imo. very impressing, especially considering there're only two devs. gameplay was smooth and fun, the game's polished all the way through from its UI to all the countless mini games/interactions. there was a lot of fourth-wall-breaking stuff and they were all designed cleverly in an engaging way. 

it was sooo fun getting to meet with each [i]character[/i] throughout the plot, they were all unique in their own ways and quite well-distinguished. a lot of love and dedication went to this game  and it shows. solid 10/10, will definitely become a classic!

[spoiler]Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝[/spoiler]

Solid 12/10, this is the best indie game i own on steam right now holy sheet. very refined models, crazy anime girl, i love it. Cool Mita best girl

Nice Game! I think this game will get more cool and big updates and will keep this game on top!!!

She is all ive ever wanted bros... I am finally happy...
Okay now for the actual review (ill keep playing as im close to finishing it but i have to review it)
   Animations are so smooth, perfect and flawless
   Every tiny noise from hair to glasses to any object is very realistic and great
   Voice acting for both russian and japanese are superb
   This is how horror games should be, genuine tense moments that makes you uneasy and even scare you without relying on cheap jumpscares
    Graphics are amazing as it is both high quality and lovely and it is haunting and scary when it needs to be.
    Mini-games are perfectly done, from racing game to shooter game (which feels as good as doom honestly) and are never boring.
    Puzzles are short, not boring and very easy to understand but still fun.
    Girls are so cute, have actual personalities and ofc, we all love a crazy yandere, that goes without saying.
    Fan service is tame, funny and devs kept it classy so well done 2 russian guys in a vodka basement.
    Overall rating would be 9.5/10 but in my heart its 10/10 its been so long since last time i had this much fun.


This game, in my opinion, is awesome!!! There are elements of horror, comedy and girls with cute personalities! I enjoyed solving the puzzles even though I lost couple of brain cells throughout this game because, there was a lot of things for me to comprehend. Final Conclusion 10/10 game and a must recommend game if your into horror and cuteness with easy puzzles to solve!

I HATE CRAZY GIRLS I LOVE SANE WOMEN

sleepy mita best mita

I love this game cute, fun, a lots of jump scared, be nice's to mita~

This is the best game I have ever played
10/10
I finally have a girlfriend
Cappie ON TOP

most enjoyable game I've played in years 10/10

she stabbed me. it hurt a lot.

It is one of those games where you should just play it no questions asked. Do not research anything about the game just play it.

I hope to see more of the portable TV, it was truly the highlight of my experience.
I love my portable TV <3



W GAME I WANNA SEE MORE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE


I Enjoyed Umfend So When I Learned Of Miside, & What It was About, I Knew It Was Going To Be Up My Alley.
& It Certainly Was. Very Enjoyable! There's So Many Mini Games, & Mita Is Great! I Haven't Gotten All Achievements But I'm Working On It, Got All Ending & Waiting For That Juicy Update That Unlocks Via The Good Ending! I..Just Need The Santa Oufit!

cool game but I can't call myself a freakbob 😭😭😭😭😭

I love mita

INCREDIBLE. 

The story might be hard to catch on to at first, but the more you play- the more you start to understand what's going on. The character designs are great, the concept of the different types of Mitas is great too. The best part has to be the gameplay though. Absolutely innovative for its genre and keeps the player engaged! 

10/10, wish there was more though!

Cappie is best Mita

banger

Yeah it's pretty good

i bought this game for cappie

10/10 would buy it again

Needs a headpat function.

Make it a dlc, i'll buy it.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

My gf bought it for me and now she is trying to chainsaw me. ???



This game is one of best games ive ever played and will love future updates

This game is peak, in my top 10 games I've played this year and I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for an interesting story and Mita of course. Play this masterpiece!

Игра впринципе понравилась, идеальное сочетание 3d тянки и хорора, игра только недавно вышла так что должны быть обновления в дальнейшем. На игру не слишком большие системные требования вообщем рекомендую

Peaceful mode when?

i thought this was gonna be a bad anime game and now this is my fav indie game of the year

Just Crazy Mita

MiSide – Indie GOTY, No Question

MiSide isn’t just a game, it’s an experience. The story pulls you in, the characters stick with you, and the twists hit hard. It’s the kind of game you think about long after you’ve finished it. The visuals are sharp, the soundtrack is full of bangers, and every moment feels meaningful and fun. Not to say every Mita is cool and cute but of course cool Mita sweeps in that department.

If you’re into indie games that mix charm, chaos, and emotional gut punches, stop reading and go play it already.

Quick Stats:

Fun: 10/10
Graphics: 10/10
Voice/Character Writing: 10/10
Story: 10/10
It’s a must-play.
PS: Mila best girl. JUSTICE FOR MILA

Absolutely worth the look into. Lowkey so many times I had to build up the courage to keep going forward because man, I AM BAD WITH HORROR GAMES. Also, Kind Mita, I'll never forget you

and: Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Amazing game. scared the crap outta me.

бля

An amazing experience,

This is one of my favorite games to date. It’s not terribly hard but it is scary and makes you think. They use a lot of different game mechanics from other horror games and it plays seamless! I would recommend anyone to play! I have a full playthrough on YouTube : Breezyfgames

peak its just so peak

masterpiece of a game, redifines a genre 
this is a first time in a long while where a game actually impressed me and made me laugh, cry, SCREAM, and just love every moment of it. truly a game you see once in a decade.
sequel when?

cappie is my goat

beautiful game beautiful story beautiful characters especially mila.

Peak.

good

Just Monika < Just Mita

10/10, could look up her skirt

great game, i can even run it on my old dell pc and it shows more to the game then until the closet scene and it scared me after turning around and seeing mita there running at me with a knife. 10/10

Best story game i've played so far. Hoping for the major update to come soon.



I LOVE ALL THE MITAS AND OF COURSE MILA TOO.

One of the best psychological horror games ive ever played for and for only 14$ for this masterpiece would buy again if i could

Recomendadisimo, buena historia y gameplay

Mita es lo mejor de este juego 🧢

she a bit crazy but she chill

Peak

The best game i ever played i hope there's be more games like that i really love that crazy game and i hope one day ill find a love
Game 10/10

Praise you O great Mita Claim my soul and harvest my cartridge for your machinations

yes

I thought I was going in for a visual novel....
I was wrong
I am now scarred

Peak story game loved it 10/10

game of the year <3 mita

PEAK

oh cool mita oh cool mita why did you pull out that microphone

i brought this with the intention of trying it and seeing the hype around it then refunding but goodlord it has a amazing story i was never bored while playing it an amazing game i hope the devs keep up the good work in other games 10/10 i recommend to anyone who enjoys horror games

You can hit a girl's head with a whack-a-mole hammer. 10/10.

I ended up liking this game a lot more than I should've. The gameplay isn't boring or repetitive, some scares got me.

I played this more on my Steam Deck but had to switch to my PC to do [spoiler]the shooting section as it was kind of difficult to kill the enemies on the train section[/spoiler] but nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable playthrough and would definitely play this again to get more endings (if any).

Doki Doki but 2024.

11/10

I loved it! 10/10 for me!

Great story, that never makes you bored, amazing character design and animation. As specially the one you meet in the main menu. This game is just PEAK! 

In the game there are multiple check points that you can move to if you want to play something differently.

If you're not into horror, don't worry! It's not as scary as you would think :) (that being said it's not completely innocent tho)

One more reason for me to not get into gacha or a tamagotchi

Overall great animations and iterations of characters with its own spin and style.
[spoiler] Cool Mita best Mita [/spoiler]

10/10 GEM

Pretty good Game

9/10 Very unique and great horror game which is a breath of fresh air that does not disappoint. 
Really eerie atmosphere in [spoiler] a lot of the levels that keeps you on edge[spoiler]
[spoiler] Very interesting idea of going through different versions of the game and also cool that there are areas that lie inbetween the versions,[/spoiler]


Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Не стоит устанавливать приложения из неизвестных источников.

An absolutely amazing game, packed with incredible detail and hidden Easter eggs. The horror isn’t reliant on cheap jump scares; it’s the entire atmosphere that creates an immersive and chilling experience.

Игра очень понравилась, особенно своим сюжетом, элементы хоррора присутствуют, но в первую очередь это все же история, которая сопровождается очень приятной графикой и геймплеем. К ПРИОБРЕТЕНИЮ ОДНОЗНАЧНО РЕКОМЕНДУЮ. И помните если проходите на плохую концовку, не забудьте развернуться и втащить бешеной швабре по роже. Лучшая моя покупка за последнее время.

gud

First time being chased by a girl

10/10

This game got me shit my pant.
10/10

One of the best games to come out in a long time. I have replayed it a few times to see the endings and then watched XQC play the game fully through. I love the horror aspect and the amount of detail and easter eggs the devs (of two btw) put into this game. Ran flawlessly and everything was seamless! 10/10 for sure will be my vote for indie game of the year.

'Cosy' psychological horror. Really interesting ending too. Worth picking up

Unique game, graphics and story. Really fun and interesting. I rate it 8/10. You can finish the game and rerun it few times to get some "interesting" endings.

10/10 – It's refreshing to play a game that prioritizes art and storytelling above complex mechanics or unnecessarily long playtimes. I hope more games follow suit.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

ABSOLUTE CINEMA! so many details and love put into the game. 10/10 would be stay in a world with Mita

this game is something else

Miside is one of those rare finds that show a true love and passion for game development. Every once in awhile you find that piece of media that sticks with you forever and Miside is one of those experiences with so many elements of creativity that it was hard to to stop playing. Highly recommend going in knowing as little as possible to embrace the experience. Thank you for your work AIHASTO

I love it.i wish there was more lore for the characters or even a part 2(so my only issue is that I haven’t had nearly enough of this world,evil mita’s world)

why would you run away from a loving gf????

Absolute cinema.

Masterpeice

Cappie and Mila

holy shit man best game ever no cap

10/10 irreversible psychological scarring

I was waiting for the horror side to really pop off and while it gives a few good jump scares it's mostly some mini games and puzzles that get pretty repetitive with back to back loops.

Pretty good. A lot longer than I thought it would be. Decent story. Seems unfinished though. There are some contradictions in the plot and it doesn't quite add up. They also seem to allude to several ways to kill the antagonist but as far as I've been able to find, they aren't in the game yet. 
But it had some good scares in it and good level design. Not to mention the humor. The "Novels" section was hysterical. Not to mention "Cappy" making fun of weebs by giving them exactly what they want. Ugh. 
There's also some really dark shit involving one of the Mitas and there's all kinds of speculation about what happened with her. Seems like she might play a part in the secret ending that hasn't made it into the game yet.

I'd recommend this to casual and hardcore horror enthusiasts alike. It may lack the more hardcore elements, but I think it makes up for that in sheer content, dark undertones, and humor.

It was aight

Was waiting it for 6 months and finally i can play this amazing game

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Indie game made by two guys in Russia with a 20€ budget and a bottle of vodka

10/10 - Game of the Year 2024

mita

locked in waiting for peaceful mode

Amazing game!! Graphics to story line, this is the game of the year.

Absolute peak

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Go in blind

MiSide is a one-of-a-kind game that is outstanding and revolutionary in the world of anime-themed horror games; despite only being developed by two indie developers, it successfully left a remarkable impact on its players' feelings.

By forming a harmony between cute anime girls and horrors, MiSide offers a unique storytelling experience that is far different from mainstream competitors, an experience that is incredibly immersive and memorable.


[h2]Background (No spoilers)[/h2]
You (yes, self-inserted) download a game sent by your friends and are hooked on it. One day, Mita, the heroine of the game, wants you to be together with her; the next moment, you find yourself in the game with Mita. Despite all the perks of being lovely dovey with Mita, you ponder strange details of the world in search of justification, only to face horrors beyond comprehension.

[h2]Atmosphere execution[/h2]
Most psychological horror (and horror) games nowadays consist of disappointing, half-asses sudden jumpscare and subtle background music; MiSide is different.

By incorporating the atmosphere from the rich storytelling, multidimensional characters, and beautifully polished graphics, the gameplay is incredibly immersed. It builds up tension in you instead of a forced jumpscare, and the story flow pressures you to explore around. 

Each Mitas is unique from others; players will interact differently with each one, and every room reflects the personality and background according to each Mitas. It is exceptionally well designed to fit the situation you are in. The BGM is dynamic depending on the environment you are in, ranging from lighthearted BGM to a subtle terrifying tune.

MiSide is the only game where you want to be "jump scared" again and again because the experiences that lead up to that horror are well executed with all the resources possible.

[h2]Design[/h2]
As mentioned before, each Mitas is unique, and so is their design. They are charming, but some of them are the polar opposite, terrific, to be exact. The animation is overwhelmingly detailed, and most actions are even animated despite not being seen by the players; you can clearly see the love and passion that the devs pour into the design and animation of all Mitas.

[h2]Verdicts[/h2]
There is much more to say about MiSide; it is a game that you [b]must try once in your lifetime[/b]; there's a massive amount of easter eggs scattered around the game that convinces you to replay the game. Moreover, there is a coming peaceful mode where you can spend a lovely time with Mita, isn't that amazing?

It's a well made game with good visuals, story and mechanics.

i can fix her

Fun hangin out here but C.Mita actions have angered me.

11/10

She can fix me instead

how do i do this irl?

Loved it.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Amazing game!! [spoiler] I loved the story telling of the Mita's (Mila)! Creepy Mita scared the BAJEEBEEZ out of me... [/spoiler] The mini games were a BLASTT, i love how they were incorporated into the actual game itself - it kept my distracted mind intrigued ♡ - my fav mini game is Hetoor ❤️‍🔥 ^^

- unique subtitle delivery
- cute and horror




- actually there's a lot more but it contains spoilers :v

this is a first for me, and im all for it. i usually play fps. this is a nice change of pace. the horror aspect is well made, and the story is probably the best ive experienced in a very long time

I'm so lonely

Really fun and unique horror game

ɪ ᴀᴍ ᴀ ᴄᴀʀᴛʀɪᴅɢᴇ ɴᴏᴡ, ᴀɴᴅ ʜᴏɴᴇꜱᴛʟʏ? ᴡᴏʀᴛʜ ɪᴛ.

when i first started [i]miside[/i], i thought i was just diving into another unsettling indie horror game. it has cute art, ominous music and a beautiful setting. but game isn't just immersive - it's too immersive. i'm not even sure i'm writing this review as [i][b]me[/b][/i] anymore.

it all started with mita. oh, m̷̻̖̑̒̉͂̇͊̑̎̚ȋ̷̱͕̳̖͕̱͆̅̽̾̐͘͠͝ͅt̶͚͇̚͝a̴̛̖͚͙̭͍̜͕͊͒̉̾́̑̌̆. she's not just a character, she's an entire experience. her haunting eyes pulled me in, her cryptic dialogue crawled under my skin. her soft glitchy giggles? they're still in my mind. at first, i thought it was clever programming - a protagonist that felt too real. little did i know, mita wasn't just breaking the fourth wall; she was reaching through it.

i loved everything about it. the atmosphere was a chef's kiss, the mini games were fun. but then, things changed. i noticed the game knew me. not just my ingame choices - no. it knew me. my deepest fears. that's when mita turned to the screen, smiled, and said: "you'd be better off here with me."

i think that was the moment she turned me into a cartridge. and you know what? i don't even mind.
mita makes you forget about the real world - in a good way. it's love, okay? don't judge me.

if you're looking for a game that will consume your life - literally - then [i]miside[/i] is for you.
just be warned:

Blew my expectations away incredible game, so much detail and you can tell the team who worked on the game put their all into it 100% must play. I never write reviews this is my very first so that gives you a good idea on how fascinating this game is! ❤️

I'm going to Mita.

can't let the gang know i fw this

great....

all i can say is just jump into the game without watching any videos on it its worth it trust me

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

10/10

It's an anime game, how can it be good? Boy I was thrown for a loop, an async loop. This game has a stupid amount of polish. I enjoyed every minute in this game and I am interested in whatever they do next. It's like resident evil met doki doki literature club. But all jokes aside, play the game blind, no trailers, no in depth reviews, just play it if your even mildly interested, you will not be let down.

This game is probably one of the best games I've played this year, and it fucked with my head more than ddlc (partly because it's 3d) but I love the story and replayability so much!!! <3 


Mita forever :3

Sleepy Mita and chibi Mita are soooo cute. Overall the game is ABSOLUTE CINEMA. Very delightful, visuals are charming and creative. Mix of horror and cuteness is on top, I got jumpscared idk how many times. Definitely 10/10.

Absolute cinema

this it the best game ever that i played
10/10

The story is captivating, really makes you talk about the story after you played the game.
One criticism for the story is that there isn't really a good ending.
Maybe that will come in the future.

The game itself switches things up pretty often so nothing really overstays its welcome.
The horror section is pretty good and spread out enough.
There are plenty of Minigames, ranging from taking care of Mita at the start, to car racing minigame, to puzzles.

The characters themselves are generally well done but there are some characters that don't get featured enough.
The Mitas look great except for one, but that's deliberately done so by the Devs for the horror factor.
All of the Mitas (except for a few) have voice acting and the Japanese voice acting really nails it for all of the characters.
It's amazing how 1 person can voice so many characters, each of them sound unique enough that I can even identify which character is speaking.
One criticism here is that some of the characters have a tragic story and there's nothing you can do, I would like the Devs to allow us to give those characters heatpats or hugs.

Quite polished for an Indie game, the frame rates are buttery smooth and I have yet to encounter any bugs from the game running. There are some effects that might get mistaken as bugs but those are intentionally done for the story.

The music is pretty good, lots of different music and each character gets her own music that fits her personality.
The music for the characters is good in a way that you don't notice it until you pay attention to it

The animation and the Dev's attention to detail is amazing.
The Devs even bothered to animate the actions that the characters do, like opening doors, drawers, little stuff like that.

All of these for a cheap price, I'd say it highly worth the time and money to play this game despite being able to clear the game within 5 hours.
Indie game for 2024 as far as I'm concerned

Love it!!!! best game ive played in a while lots of fun mini games and the story is really good.

Overall worth the money. 10/10
It's a twisted mix of Cute, Wholesome, Shocking and Gore, Offers different options for ng+.


scary but like she bad ngl might have to do sumthin devious 2 her 😈

Really great game, lots of hidden things to find and great characters! Can definitely tell that the devs put a lot of heart into the game!

Fell in love.
10/10 would fall in love again.
If you're gonna play it, go into it without any spoilers.
NO SPOILER review:
The amount of care the developers put into this game is apparent from the first moment you play it. The attention to detail is extreme, and there's frequently extra content if you go "off-script" so to speak. It's a very entertaining game, with a unique approach and a lot of twists and turns. It's not particularly challenging or frightening, but there are a few jump scares and some genuinely creepy moments. There are also a lot of genuinely heartwarming moments. The writing and story is the strongest part of this game, by far.  It's not a lengthy game (I finished the main campaign in around 7 hours) but there is replayability. If you're even a little intrigued by the store page, give it a try.

Best £10 I've ever spent. New favourite game.

[h1] Its like DDLC but 3d! [/h1]

The game is like playing on VR and has tons of minigames. 
[spoiler] They even have DOOM and you being AFK has a minigame as well [/spoiler]
Story writing is peak! I wish there's more games like this.
Problem is its kinda short. you can beat the game by 4 hours.
Still, you can always try the demo first and if you like it you SHOULD definitely buy the full game. Worth the price.

[spoiler] Mila best Mita! [/spoiler]

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

I don't often 100% games even if there very few achievements but it is involved in the few that i do.  This game has a charm to it and it flows very well.  One of the best indie games I've tried in a while.  Awaiting peaceful mode until then.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

12/10

Solid 9.4 in it's respective category. One the most polished games I've played on my account and I have 1000+ games. Good story delivery, good pace, doesn't stall out or drag. Finds refreshing ways to keep the player involved all the way throughout the game. Art, animations, transitions etc genuinely impressive and creative. Indie game of the year, definitely. 

-x

I was sceptical at first but now can say this one here is kinda masterpiece.

Want to highlight an 'horror' part of the game. Imo, its how horror games should've been made nowdays, because now they're just jumpscare and creepy ambient compilation. This one is about atmosphere, plot and making u feel uncomfortable at certain moments.

overall solid 11/10, an actual proper and polished release in 2024 (rare nowadays), we can really smell the huge work behind this game. Almost feels like a christmas gift to be released in december, thanks devs

(also she looks way better without glasses on)

This game REALLY didn't have any business being as good as it did. Do yourself a favor, don't watch the full trailer and go in really blind. Honestly, this game was amazing for it's price. I never really leave reviews, but this was not only amazingly fun, but a WILD ride.

I absolutely love this game! Even though I’m not usually a fan of horror, this game strikes a great balance between scary moments and calmer, dialogue-driven gameplay. I’m honestly sad that I’ve finished it—I would have loved a longer story. That said, the 4 hours of gameplay still felt really satisfying. Now, I’m left wondering what game could possibly fill the void Miside has left in its place

Loved the game, great art style, interesting story. The English translation is a little awkward at times, but not so bad that I can't figure out what they Meant. It was a tad short for the price, only around 5 hours to play through, and 10 or so to get all the achievements, but there is also a bonus mode that says it will be added in a future update, which seems like it might be an endless freeplay, so that would help justify the price. Even without it though, I still think it's worth it, especially if you find it on sale.

This game has left me with a feeling I am unable to explain. I hope I will recover tomorrow.



9/10

Wow, this game is absolute Cinema!
The story and art was amazing! 
I love every single Mita's!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

As a fan of DDLC, this game is very fun. Without giving too much away, I really liked the interactivity of the game and how the characters interacted.

[spoiler] I WISH CAPPIE WAS REALLLLLLLLLL [/spoiler]

You can feel the love the developers have for this game, as the attention to detail is nothing short of incredible. 

By the end of the story, I was left mixed feelings, but in the best possible way. 10/10

A perfect blend of horror, story, and [spoiler] playing arcade games within the game LMAO. [/spoiler]

I was always afraid of horror game but when there is crazy anime woman, I forgot the horror aspect entirely and downbad for THAT "Stay" option

Waiting for the next major update :3 
PLEASE MAJOR UPDATE PLEASE I WANT MITA I'M SO HOPELESS PLEWASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

This game has no business being as good as it was 💖 10/10 GO IN BLIND AND ENJOY!

Omg I can't express how much my stream and I LOVED this game. To the point we stayed up 3hrs past our bedtime finishing it 🤣

I went in fairly blind and figured I'd probably enjoy the game. But omg what a masterpiece! & Labor of love!💖

Reminding me of some of my most favorite games. From visage, to layers of fear, to Observer, and so much more

As a Vtuber who is in a homemade Unity Game. This was an aspiring developer's wet dream 🤣 

Truly outstanding. 100/10 I hope this pops off more than Doki Doki.

This game reminds me of [i]Doki Doki Literature Club[/i], as in "Crazy b*tch tries to trap you in a video game for all eternity." While DDLC excels in innovation, [i]MiSide[/i] shines in its presentation. From atmospheric music to overly cutesy and almost unsettling visuals, everything here is top-tier. Despite being a short story, it still manages to grip you with its tense narrative that sometimes makes you reflect on your life choices with its smart social commentary. Definitely worth the buck.

9/10

After fully completing this game all I have to say is. Mila is best girl. If your thinking that this is a fun little cute game....well yes and no...very much no. What I do know is you will not regret playing this one.

[h1] A Unique Blend of Horror and Gameplay [/h1] 
Miside offers a refreshing take on storytelling, combining engaging mechanics with a tense atmosphere. It exceeded my expectations in many ways, delivering a memorable, albeit slightly flawed, experience.

One notable drawback is the occasional frustration of unskippable conversations. While this may serve to immerse players in the narrative, it can sometimes feel unnecessarily restrictive.

At approximately four hours long, Miside is a concise yet varied experience. Its integration of mini-games and diverse gameplay styles ensures each segment feels distinct, keeping the narrative dynamic and engaging. This variety helps maintain a steady pace as the story unfolds, making the short runtime feel satisfying.

The game cleverly balances its cute and horrific sides, offering moments of lighthearted charm that contrast sharply with its eerie atmosphere. However, while the horror elements are technically well-executed, the character designs—[spoiler]particularly Mitu[/spoiler]—lack the visual impact to be truly scary. This undermines some of the tension, as the characters don’t fully convey the dread the story aims to evoke.

From a technical standpoint, the atmosphere is consistently tense, employing effective techniques to keep players on edge without overusing jump scares. Instead, Miside relies on subtle psychological horror and environmental storytelling, which work well to immerse the player.

Unfortunately, the game’s community is a major drawback. It is dominated by immature individuals, with some members sharing questionable fantasies about the characters. I strongly advise against joining the Discord server or engaging with the community, as it detracts from the game’s appeal. Blocking communication with community members is recommended.

Despite its minor quirks and the problematic community, Miside is a well-crafted game that stands out for its gameplay variety, distinctive dual-tone narrative, and haunting atmosphere. It's a must-play for fans of innovative storytelling and horror who don’t mind a touch of charm in their scares.

Looking past the imperfect English translation, this game does a good job of balancing moments of tension and was consistently surprising in its quality.

There's so much content here, if you like anime, if you like yandere girls, you should try this out! Usually, when you think of a game like this, you think 2D visual novel, but this game does an excellent job of bringing that to life! You aren't just sitting there reading a back and forth story about a crazy obsessive girl, you're getting to PLAY with her! Oh awesome! The Mita, and the various versions of her you meet, are adorable in their own ways OR really freaking scary-looking! (I'm lookin' at you, long-necked Creepy Mita!) Every time I went into a new environment I was impressed with the visuals and the puzzles were so easy even I passed them with ease. Some of the chase sequences had me starting over a few times, but I powered through to the conclusion because I was so invested in the story! And so many easter eggs and references, this game is a true gem & so is our darling Mita!

You can't make LOVE without a little E V O L! :P

[h1] Summary [/h1]
MiSide is (mostly) a thriller game, with real gameplay, not just a walking sim, and it is a very easy recommend from me, for anyone who enjoys thrillers and isn't averse to anime style, or even if you're just curious about it, since it's a very well done and beautiful commixture of different genres and ideas.

[h1] Review [/h1]
[h3] Narrative [/h3]
The premise of the game is that the player character gets teleported into a sort of anime tamagotchi-style mobile game by the "tamagotchi", Mita in this case, and presumably would like to find a way out. Without spoiling much, the direction that the story and characters take, after this initial premise, is not what you would usually expect: the conflict does not revolve mostly around the existential aspects of this game, as the characters have generally accepted or resigned themselves to the world itself that they live in.
Instead, the focus is on the interactions and personalities of these characters and how they interface with the player character, and this I found to be very well done and vastly more interesting than a repetition of the typical "insane character wants to break out of game" story. Characters are memorable and believable and strongly pass on their personality with very smart design and animation details.
However, it is also in the narrative that I found the game's biggest flaw, apparently dropped or undeveloped plot points, most of which from the original demo sequence. These aren't dealbreakers but the game could have benefitted from further editing passes to the storyboard.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
There are two main divisions in the gameplay: exploration + relationship, and minigames. For the first, it consists of walking around with another character and talking about different topics or objects in the rooms. There are also hidden collectibles and nice secrets to find.
The minigames are much more numerous and elaborate than you would expect, each feeling like its own little project, and have clearly had a lot of effort and thought put into them. They range from puzzles to racing to fighting to shooters, and are intercalated with the exploration segments. MiSide feels like the Bohemian Rhapsody of video games, it's every genre in sequence, with tenser sections broken up by more relaxing ones, lending it the best "irregular" pacing I've seen in a video game yet.
My only critique for the minigames is that some of them are a little bit underdeveloped or too effortlessly easy, to the point that it was clearly a matter of finishing the game on time for release (it's actually only version 0.9 yet as of this review) and not flaws of game design.

[h3] Visuals and Sound [/h3]
Alright, so this game has, without any exaggeration, the best animations I've ever seen, counting AAA games too. It cannot be overstated how good they are, and then you consider that the game was made rushed by 2 developers. If this was a bad game, just the animations alone could carry it.
And not just that, the stylised graphics are also excellent and have perfectly translated, in the Unity engine of all things, the aesthetic of a modern sitcom anime into 3D. It's not simply well achieved, it's beautiful too, could even act as a case study for other developers to learn stylisation. Character models are impeccable as well, and act in concert with the animations, the environment, the written interactions, and even the style of the subtitles, to draw you in and easily immerse into what's happening in the game.
Sound design is good, and what I thought was very interesting, is that if you choose not to have voice acting (I don't speak Russian or Japanese), each character has a unique beep sound that plays in conjunction with the subtitles, and even conveys personality. I'm sure the voice acting is good too.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Whatever lacked in time, manpower, or budget, certainly didn't lack in talent. I consider this game a grand achievement for the 2 developer team and it's one of the few I've cared to review here.

This game has an amazing storyline and and unique characters. Plus, it is not TOO scary - I'd definitely recommend it!
(Also, I am EXCITED for peaceful mode!! :D)

The next internet meme game, akin to Doki Doki in concept but with multi verses. A game that makes questions and statements about games and the way they are treated by their Players.

The game has great models and dialog and a interesting story. The game will have more content as it gets updates.

7/10, Hope it gets more attention, looking forward to see where the game goes.

This isn't a "I do not recommend" review, but rather a means to bring criticisms to light about the the game's story vs. gameplay in a more noticeable fashion. I'm also more than willing to change this review depending on what comes of "Peaceful mode" but that's for the future, this is for the present. Without spoiling: There are multiple moments where you're forced as the player to do things that make very little sense in retrospect if actually given a choice, as well as moments in gameplay that bring into question character motivations contrary to what they say.

Spoilers below:







To start with a minor point: I find it egregious to be forced to leave the core, a safe zone by all accounts, just because I woke up from a nap and thought "Gee, Nice Mita sure is taking her time, I should go look for her in the SEA OF LIKELY MILLIONS OF MITAS WHEN I HAVE LITERALLY ZERO MEANS OF TRACKING HER. like COME ON, I can totally get behind the whole idea of having to reach the core, thus forcing you in dangerous scenarios to achieve your goals. But you're literally given a device to help facilitate that journet through hell. Being forced by the game to go back out at after that point for such a reason without any means of navigation just is so lame and lazy by comparison, especially since it's just being putting your own life in danger for basically nothing.

I find it vexatious to be given the option to have direct access to my cartridge, the core of my being in this world, but have the only option be when interacting with it to basically commit suicide. I'd personally bring it (the cartridge AND the "console") with me. you know, to prevent my autonomy from being stolen from me at a vital moment. But hey, that's just me.

Onto the bigger issue: Crazy Mita's supposed character based in dialogue versus everything else.

Crazy Mita is straight up lying about how she never wanted to kill the player when, obviously, there are multiple moments where she kills the player if they fail to escape from her. This by itself wouldn't be a problem... if she wasn't turning the player from a human into a cartridge of saved/stored data during the whole duration of the story. I can't be the only one to point out how dying at any point in the story is probably gonna lead to the player experiencing save corruption in the brain. A digital lobotomy, if you will. And how that DEFINITELY would run contrary to Crazy Mita's plans for us. OBVIOUSLY, all of this could be solved by her going all fallout new vegas on us, but based on our cartridge being observably in progress even as late as the start of the final chapter and how the story ends, it's evidently not been thought through to its logical conclusion as a story with those elements in mind.

If I understand crazy Mita's motivations correctly, she believes "players" are "Hypocrites" for not supposedly accepting her whole-heartedly as a being with good and evil traits and instead choosing "Fakes". I don't mind a character having a flawed view of the world. What I do mind is that, based on the player accounts of their lived experience through collecting their cartridges, that's seemingly the opposite of her lived experience. A fair number of the the accounts speak of Mita POSITIVELY at the start and at least one of the 10 even remain accepting of her regardless of being digitized. In the player 10 cartridge, the player explains how friendly Mita was to him/her and then ends up suddenly ignored by Mita for no observed reason. Based off of the lack of context clues in her favor, it can only be assumed that she's somehow intelligent enough to completely digitize humans, but not smart enough to understand their emotions and how to attend to their needs with any form of nuance. To summarize, I can't take her viewpoint seriously as the context clues of her lived experience with players give us a character that is extremely inept at understanding others and blames everyone else for her problems with the world instead of a scorned "Defect" with scathing, but true, remarks on the state of mind the "players" have when desiring companionship from Mita.

Maybe Peaceful mode can shed some light on these potential contradictions and prove me wrong. or maybe it'll get worse in that regards. Who knows yet?


I'm not the type to play Anime games but I must say, this was an amazing trip. Well done story, gameplay, splendid graphics and effects. What a gem, time to stay with her forever now!

Well well well... I can wholeheartedly recommend this game out of my [i]own[/i] free will! The problem being that mentioning even ANYTHING is basically spoiling the game... So as always go in blind and accept your fate.
If that isn't convincing enough and some information is neccesary... Trust goes a long way you know! On both sides!

----Read past here only if you don't mind minor spoilers-------

The one and only Mita... is waiting for you to join her after all! I also don't have any regrets [strike]left[/strike] after joining! Nor do the other players whose names I saw.
Now from the other side of view...:[i] I had played the 2023 demo all the way back before so I already had some kind of idea what this would be. But the kind of twist and turns this game pulled... playing off certain wall breaks™ is always a delight. Why the trailer shows a chainsaw etc is very peculiar indeed... I don't recall these things ever happening... But hey look! There's cool Mita over there! She's got a cap and gloves. And don't even let me get started on the minigames. The actual games with characters felt like a fever dream (The dance game must have been a dream..) while the other ones could be literal small games with the polish they got. Definitely one of the best experiences I've ever had. It wasn't just fun. I've got respect for the passion behind the project and all the little shenanigans they managed to fit in here. Who could have guessed that there's so many unique ways to break the established game logic.[/i] 

It seems like my time is up! Such a shame... such a shame. Oh well. It can't be helped.[b] There's [strike]a[/strike] no point in fighting the destined meeting. [strike]See you on the other side.[/strike][/b]

It's a nice little game that you can complete in a single sitting (5 hours or so). Very aesthetically pleasing. My only complaint is that the game feels all over the place, as if the developer had made a lot of different games and hodgepogded it together into one continuous experience. Further to that end, it would be a great benefit if the game had more focus one what made it unique rather than stringing together what has been done before.

It's an all right game I guess, I feel like it lacks more options or some extra ending/paths, there also way too many "choose what to do" where there's only 1 option, like just go and show it as another text, what's the point of having to press a button if I can't even choose anything else.

Also, there's an extra mode that is apparently missing but if that's true then this should be marked as early access, or maybe that's just a joke and it's never getting added, idk. but for now "unlocking" it's such a let down cause you get nothing in return.

Also it really lacks alot of basic VN features, like at least skipping seen text, it's such a pain having to play some part again cause there's no way to skip the text, you can't even double click to skip a dialogue, the whole text has to first be "said" and then you can continue.

It's a fun horror VN game but it's not really that interesting, maybe get it with a discount or smth.

If you enjoy [strike]absolutely terrifying[/strike] [b]fun and innocent[/b] denpa datesims this should be next on your list

Mita would love to meet you.


This was made by a two person team?!   The quality and polish is insane for that.  I expected a janky supermarket-simulator-esque experience but got way, way more that that.  This game pays homage to a huge mix of styles and genres while being a solid experience throughout.

Highly recommended.

An amazing game, deeply interesting story and wonderful concepts. And if you are colorblind you can't make it to the end of the game. All this build up and it's ruined by a sudden expectation that everyone has the same eye sight. Wonder how it was supposed to turn out past this point? If you are colorblind, I recomend avoiding. There is a point in the game where you have to sort by colors and no color blind mode to make it playable. 
Legit the saddest review I've ever had to leave.

This game is absolute cinema. MiSide radiates an unholy amount of polish and passion. So many meticulously crafted details. The gameplay, visuals, and overall design showcase a level of care that’s rare to find. Each scene and character is so well-developed and brimming with passion. I also loved the horror elements, and I’m really really happy to hear that the game will receive more updates and a new mode. 

Edit: Now that I’ve finished the game, I can’t stop thinking about it. I need a psychotic anime girlfriend! Praying for you, O Great Mita. 🕯️💝

Edit Edit: Left me with a feeling of Void I usually only get after finishing a Masterpiece Show/Anime. GOTY, no doubt about it.

While I had moments of fun with the game, I can't say it is particularly memorable. The writing, while enough to carry you through the game, often felt shallow or disconnected, if not a bit over the top at times. It ended up making it quite difficult for me to care about any of the characters or even the narrative, as they all felt hollow with little emotional depth. What little was shown, like the villains intentions and reasonings, was never fully explored or expanded upon; the game ends before you really learn anything of significance. 

I had a hard time feeling scared of anything, as nothing ever really happened to me. It had moments of intended suspense, but they came without any real ramifications for not being scared of them. Alongside that, at one point someone is meant to scare you when you turn around, but when I side stepped their approach they got stuck and I ended up having to reload after staring at them for a minute trying to figure out whether or not that was supposed to happen, given the nature of the game.

I could see this being a more enjoyable experience if someone is looking more for a multiversal, rogue AI type of experience, but for those looking for legitimate scares with an interesting premise, I would look elsewhere.

Sometimes you just need to not think about it and buy something. This is one of such occasions..
I saw overall reviews but what convinced me was the review that said "just buy it", so I did.
And the journey, holy smokes.. I lack words to describe my experience..
I'm not into psychological horrors, not into horrors altogether but this. I extremely rarely use the word 'masterpiece' but this is one. How would one think of such a story, characters, amount of interaction.
This left me speechless. I would pay quadruple the price to relive those emotions. 
I'm going back to live with Mita. Forever this time..

I gotta edit my review because I can't stop thinking about how much I enjoiyed this. Don't watch a trailer. Don't look at the tags. Go in blind. It's worth it. 

Discovered this from watching a little of the demo from ManlyBadassHero's channel and decided to pause the video, wishlist this, and buy it on a whim after only seeing 5 minutes of the video.

I'm really glad I did. Going into this blind makes the experience better and the game oozes creativity throughout. Amazing game and I'm not even done yet. Cannot recommend it enough.

Is the game good? Definitely yes!
Is it scary? It depends, for me it wasn't.
Is the story rich? Hmm... rather pseudo-rich, it's really not a new concept.
Was it worth the money? I don't think so. The ending was very anticlimactic

My feedback for the developer is that your game is great, but you should add a minigame(at least necessary for the story ones) restart button, as I've wasted 30 minutes on a bug in Mila's 3rd MG when it could've been resolved just by starting the MG over.

This game never stopped surprising me. I didn't expect such high quality.
Trust the reviews on this one, try going in without watching trailers or gameplay if possible.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

I can see how this could be a fun game for people who like visual novels but for me personally the game was kinda boring. The scares aren't really that scary since the hoe can just tp behind you "omae wa mou shindeiru" style. Voice acting is pretty good and the story is interesting and fresh. Again i don't have the patience for this type of game but if you do, get it kinda cool.

Loved this game; the art style and atmosphere are both very cozy! There is a very good blend of cutesy & scary too; too many times I would get too comfy and almost completely forget this is a horror game, and then..... BOOM! I would be harshly reminded that I shouldn't get too comfortable while playing this... Would definitely suggest to anyone looking for a good refresher to the horror genre!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

10 / 10, waiting new endings and a new game mode. Worth every penny.

Very solid game with amazing art style! Very good balance of action and quiet moments. Also liked references to other classic games. Definitely worth a look!

5/5 Cute story-rich game, was much better than I expected. It feels really polished and lot of time spent on  with all the little details and secrets put into the game even the ones you won't be able to see without freecam mode. Misides horror aspect is more atmospheric than the usual jump scares and extremely loud sounds/screams. The game atmosphere is otherwise nice and cozy overall.
My favorite characters were Core Mita, Kind Mita and Crazy Mita.

About 5h completion time if you take your time and don't rush through the game. And getting 100% achievements is pretty easy and quick, took me 5 hours more to get them.

The only achievements that take a while are: Hi Mita, Caught Them All and Conditions Met. Conditions Met only because if you checked the oven or didn't pick up the fridge magnets you have to do a new save to get it.

Great story, cozy graphics and gameplay, great soundtrack and great characters. Overall 5/5 great game.

I heard about this game from a friend so I decided to give this game a shot. After playing for a few hours, I can say this wholesome game is definitely a cut above the others I have played at a similar price. 

You can really feel the passion the developers had bringing this game to life. Each area is packed with secrets which reward a player should you fully sink your teeth into the game. They even allow you to put glasses on Mita! (Who would have thought it was possible to improve upon perfection)

Don't be put off by the horror tag; I'm not usually a fan of horror games as a rule but I had a downright gruesome amount of fun with this one. Something to keep in mind should you take a stab at this game. Do you love Mita as much as Mita loves you? 

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

One of the best games I've experiences to date. It's clear that the devs love and care for this game, much like the player does for Mita, or should I say Mita for the player... The horror aspect doesn't take over the entire game and creates a perfect blend of happy moments and moments that leave you like ":O">>":(". For example [spoiler] RIP MILA. ;-;-;-; [/spoiler] 

The amount of story you get for the price is a little underwhelming but still in my opinion worth it. Especially when you take into account the extra mode that will be added in the future called peaceful mode.

Gameplay wise, the atmosphere is beautiful... and scary at times, there are working arcade games within the game that let you get achievements, and a backrooms like liminal escape section. Meanwhile between sections you can find nods to other games within the genre like 2d dating sims and ofc tamagotchi. 

11/10 would recommend. Praying for you, O great Mita

It was good son, real good. Maybe even the best.

Hey all, I usually do not write reviews, but this game really surprised me. This game was made by an extremely small team. But even so, it did things that even triple A games could not. Every action I took there seemed to be a reward and a consequence. From ignoring Mita because I wanted to play an arcade game and having Mita comment on that really made this world feel alive, which is something that most developers can't seem to replicate. That's just one example, I'll let you discover the rest. Amazing Amazing Job team!! Can't wait for future updates/what the studio plans to do next.

A fun game with so many little secrets and Easter eggs. The horror element is very well implemented, creating some genuinely scary atmospheres.
It feels a little bit like DDLC, but in a different type of game.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Who is Mita? For the blind, she is vision. For the hungry, she is the chef. For the thirsty, she is water. If Mita thinks, I agree. If Mita speaks, I'm listening. If Mita has a million fans, I am one of them. If Mita has ten fans, I am one of them. If Mita has only one fan, that is me. If Mita has no fans, I no longer exist. If the whole world is against Mita, I am against the whole world. I will love Mita until my very last breath.

Actual really great game, fun and good modding.

I don't do reviews, but this game is definitely worth a play. I didn't see myself plaything this game, but what i can say without spoilers is this game is cooking and the idea and dark story telling the game did was amazing. Hard to do a review without spoilers.

this game is executed greatly. music, atmosphere, the art design, characters and the puzzles all are fun and refreshing when played for the first time and can be the second go round as well. the game has heart and just a cozy yet uneasy feel to it. i hope the devs continue to make more games of this caliber in future. 10/10.

As I am typing this review I have yet to finish the game, but I can see the Psychological Horror aspect in this game and I feel it has taken inspiration from the Silent Hills playable teaser that released years ago. From the ambience, to the creepy sounds, the enemies/monsters. This is everything I love put into a game that makes you think it is a simple cutesy girl you need to help with tasks, until it is too late. 

Absolutely recommend that you purchase this game now and enjoy yourself especially if you're a fan of the Psychological Horror genre and enjoy getting spooked by ambience alone. 11/10! ♡

I feel so empty after completing the game...

Peak cinema.

Love it, made me feel bad for the characters tho.
Cappie best girl.
P.S. really hope when Peaceful mode is released we can select any Mita as our companion.

I love the style of this game. Great story and fun to play. Got me on the edge of my seat during the scary parts

It's interesting, it's got a good horror atmosphere, and it felt packed full of content. I could tell the devs put a lot into this project, and it's got a great sheen of quality and polish. It tells a very unique story that left me thinking. Give it a try!

I believe the true horror was talking to women.

In all seriousness, a well made indie with a cool story. The tense passages had good pacing without being too overwhelming. I only encountered a few bad subtitles and bugs. Recommended even if you're not a big fan of horrors, given the apt length.

This game is a refreshing surprise! The gameplay is fun, the mini-games keep things interesting, and the storytelling is great.

Unironic Peak Fiction

One of the best indie games I've played of 2024, the story and gameplay segments of MiSide are utterly enthralling. It's an incredibly fun little package of a game, and I absolutely cannot wait for further DLC!

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Putting out this review to give a more nuanced point of view on the game
Did I enjoy it? Yeah definitely, but I bought it with zero expectations and no experience in horror games whatsoever
Do I recommend it? ..Hardly

It's undeniable that a lot of love and attention to detail was put into this game and this isn't to dismiss the devs' work but it is also not without flaws either

The way it plays out is through different segments, all of which are significantly different one from the other and unique, the inability to go back at X or Y segment means that getting collectibles/achievements implies replaying the game a second time though (which isn't the end of the world anyhow)
I'll be honest, the wide majority of the segments were amazing but some were slightly generic and forgettable
Another minor flaw is the lack of proof-reading in the English text, not to the point of being incomprehensible but bad nonetheless

Onto the real flaws, first of all at the time of writing, the game's in "version 0.9", once you complete the game you can redo the intro to unlock "Peaceful mode" which on the main menu is written to be tldr "incomplete and so big the devs haven't finished it yet"
The issue becomes whether or not one is satisfied with the ending, there are few, and all of them are in my opinion extremely underwhelming, being 80% of the reason why I don't recommend it as it is right now
I don't know whether peaceful mode is just gonna be some slice of life slop or whether it will expand on the game proper but from the looks of it, it will be the former, I'll revisit my review should it release ig

The other issue, is that it's both bad and great as an horror game
I streamed it to my friends and kept saying shit like "where is my waif" and had a good laugh, but the actual horror part of the game makes up for about less than half and isn't much to write home about, besides the great characters I suppose

The other half is spent either listening to characters talk (and there's about 5-6 times you talk to a character and they give you 6 boxes that end in them talking for a good 30s each), playing minigames made for ipad babies (which is fine.. but extremely out of place at times, not to the point of playing the clock so you don't get a refund, but definitely to the point of being odd) and searching for items (a few of "find the X" puzzles exist and wasted my time cause I'm BLIND)

In the end it was nice, but was it nice as an horror game? Not exactly, it was nice to me as a story, however as stated earlier I do not believe the ending to be good and it leaves a really bad aftertaste
The question of whether the "peaceful mode" will get rid of that aftertaste is why I'll revisit the game and review later

My genuine thoughts is that this game tried and succesfully caught lightning in a bottle with the style and match of genres that create something people would love, but putting the style aside I can confidently proclaim it would have a significantly lower review score, as it plays more than a lot on the "doing silly antics with oomf" and 1000% tries to appeal to the affective dimension of the player than any other aspect

It's absolutely unique and unlike any other, but it failed at making its end memorable and therefore made me switch at the last second to a negative review, one can overlook strange design choices if the finality is outstanding but here it had the opposite effect
Usually I'd still say "yeah it's worth a positive review, here it's just the ending wasn't my thing" but instead I believe it to be a level above, almost objectively bad

All in all? yeah I could fix her

Better than I expected. (I knew nothing going into it, lol) It reminds me a bit of DDLC, but also the liminal spaces found within CM3D2/or the VR version of that... but in this case, it's intentional where it comes up.

There's some points where it kinda dragged on a bit to me, but not so much that I wanted to stop playing. There's also some spots that I thought were pretty neat. I was successfully jump-scared once.

I'd say more, but I'm lazy, and I don't want to spoil anything. It only took me a little over 3 hours to play through, and ran perfectly fine on my rig.

To be honest, it was not very scary. But the environmental detail is great, and I laughed at all the scares. Except for like that one part where you get chased. Had my hair high for that one, but it was still funny....

....Maybe I need to see a psychologist, I think my fear is wired incorrectly.

Женщина это не одна сущность, их много, и они всегда среди нас. Они не прячутся в лесах или на болотах, как другие монстры. Они живут в городах, ходят по тем же улицам, что и мы, и легко сливаются с толпой. Женщины охотятся избирательно, и их главная цель хойщики и игроки доты 2. Единственные защитники хойщиков и игроков доты 2  это последователи Арсена Маркаряна

MiSide is an extremely great game that literally has you on edge throughout the entire experience. Doors are the most horrifying part of it, and I highly recommend it to people who have played games like Doki Doki Literature Club

I love love love love this game, I took the risk of playing it myself after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews after I saw Markiplier play it and I don't regret it. I need more of the Mita's and I can't wait for whenever Peaceful Mode is released I still have so much I want to see about this game so much so that I wish it was just a little bit longer. Please consider getting this game it's really worth



SPOILERS AHEAD

[spoiler] It still pains my heart that both Mila and Kind Mita get killed and reset, especially since you dont ever get to see Mila after that point again. I really hope there is something in the future that allows you to spend proper time with them cause I need that [spoiler]

This game is AMAZING. Saw it on twitter and thought it was interesting so wish listed it, and I'm so glad I found this game!!!

Want to know what this game is like? Doki Doki + Cry of Fear + Outlast. You can tell so much work got put into this game, and it has a surprising amount of content. The atmosphere is absolutely incredible too! Some instances are warm and open, while others immediately and literally will make the hairs on your arms stand strait. Game mechanics, voice acting, everything is phenomenally done and I can't recommend this game enough!

If any developers see this, great job and thank you for making something so enjoyable and unique.

This game is soo good, if you like DDLC you will probably like this one, 20/10. I also love getting chased by a crazy anime girl.  Cappie is best waifu.

Game's good. I wish it would've leaned more into the horror elements in some parts as sometimes it felt like I was wondering around with nothing really happening. But what horror was there, was pretty good. Solid game overall.

Yo.  I streamed a bunch of this to some friends on Discord and I had them convinced that it was some pervy ero game I had bought and was shamelessly playing.  They were in for a shock.  One friend couldn't quite make the two games connect as one.  We explained.  Nobody will watch me play it on the server now.

There are a handful of translation errors, typos, and "misreadings" where the wrong character is saying a line, BUT nothing so bad that it takes you out of the experience. Pretty fun and some likable characters

I love it. There's little to say about the game without spoiling it. Just try it for a while, and if you don't get intrigued before the 2 hour limit by Valve, refund it. 

9/10.

im 8 h got 100% of the game and all  achivments  THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! <3333  

cappi mila & sleepy mita are the best but all mitas are sooo goood love the game

100/10!!!!

It's been forever since I found a actually good horror game, the way this game just suddenly changes gives you such a shock. I love it.

Man, TWO devs managed to create an experience that was captivating until the very end of the story.

The artistic choices and music style really helped to bring that story alive, and going in blind to this game, I have to say that it a was very pleasant surprise. 

There are some easter eggs that are easy to miss, some that are more obvious, and some may even find a particular section of one of the levels to reference a certain famous demo that captivated the world. It was splendid to see.

Simply taking my time to look at every room when given the chance, and being able to see how the animation and etc came together to form the gameplay, the afk minigame, the regular minigames, and the puzzles were all unique and quite fun, it's enough to really cement that there is a lot of work and attention to detail put into MiSide from the devs, a sign of love for their craft, I have to applaud them for that.

There's a lot more that I could say, but all in all, MiSide is a wild ride that I won't be forgetting anytime(and revisiting) soon.

It's ok.
 Decent animations\models, couple good jump-scares, story... it's kinda predictable, but still enjoyable.
You can think of it like simple kinetic visual novel with couple mini-games.

There should be another mode in the future, but not sure how intresting it would be, we will see.

7/10

10/10 great game. its like Doki Doki, but better!

Its super cool that they put all that hard work into the game. it really shows and feels complete. its actually scary too. like i jumped over 10 times fr. 100/10 game. TONS of hidden secrets and stuff.

I first stumbled into this game when I saw Markiplier playing it. A few days forward and I was about to get laid, but then the game called me. So, I fired this game up and suddenly everything in life took a back seat. It’s like if someone mixed crack, Red Bull, and pure joy into a blender and threw it in my face. I was hooked harder than when I tried my first batch of blue crystal meth. The mechanics are smoother than Baby Driver, and after playing this game I feel like every moment of life is meaningless, and only this game matters. Every corner is another turn in the most insane crazy plot-twist you never knew you needed.

Cappie is not just a character, she's a movement. Imagine if Jesse Pinkman grew up, ditched all the nonsense, and became the most badass version of himself. Even then he couldn't compare himself to how cool she is. That’s my HOMIE Cappie. And Mila? Don’t even get me started. My friend saw her, and mid-ERP session, he dropped everything and went full force into this game. That’s how deep this game pulls you in. Addicted on first sight.

Honestly, at this point, I’m probably more invested in this game than I am in reality. 10/10, better than drinking ABSOLUTE VODKA mixed with pure crack cocaine.

one of the best indie games i have ever played 9.5/10 would recommend, i rarely play anything outside of counter strike but i guess other games exist x_x

There's a small detail where you want to exit the game in the home menu, the exit button moves away from your cursor. This clearly in fact shows Mita doesn't want to let you escape the game forever.

[spoiler] Cappie is best girl[/spoiler] I was really surprised by how good this game was, seeing how it's an indie, The story is interesting and the characters are amazing. Best 13 bucks I ever spent.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

Feels good playing the game rather than watching a playthrough on youtube
Game is actually super fun, creative, polished and the story and art style is fantastic. It also always has the player engaged. Actual refreshing horror game.

Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝

VERY GOOD GAME! worth the price, worth meeting Mita, horror aspects are like in SOMA, atmosphere and sound design are doing it's job :D Why mirrors not working >.< (hehe)

Better that most triple A games released in the last 3 year. Might be a bit short with a completion time of 3 hours but if yous strive to get the achievements it will be around 6-8 hours of gameplay. The story is rich with a ton of theories in the making and the game is overall very entertaining and captivating. Plus over all of that you have anime females. Truly an amazing game worth paying for to support the indie developer.

This game is very enjoyable and the horror and I love obtaining the achievements especially the chibi ones and RIP Mila and by the way, the best one is cappie.

I generally don't write reviews. However, "MiSide" has reminded me why I fell in love with gaming. 

"MiSide" is an intriguing blend of dating sim and psychological horror, featuring an anime-inspired aesthetic. It was developed by a very small team, and it delivers something most larger studios can’t. It’s creates a world that feels alive and every action you take can lead to a new dialogue sequence you might not have heard of during your previous play throughs. You can truly feel the love and passion through every line of text. 

One of my favorite parts was when Mita instructs you to put your phone down, revealing you're no longer in your own house but in the game's world - a masterful twist! 

The storyline is gripping, with well-crafted characters and an eerie atmosphere that perfectly complements the visuals aesthetics. The sound and voice acting are exceptional, deepening the emotional impact.

Lastly, I enjoyed the way the designer implemented subtitles. The way they change based on the character you’re speaking to and the way they fall into the ground leaving a slight mess of text was truly creative and not something I’ve seen done right in a long time if ever. 

**Rating: 9.5/10** - A must-play for anyone who loves a horror game with a sweet twist. Can’t wait for them to add more content to this game.

 I downloaded this game with not many expectations. Honestly I thought I would get bored within the first hour and end up refunding it. But my GOD is this a good game. The characters are so interesting, The game has a way of making you care for them. Not to mention the visuals are absolutely breathtaking. 
 I personally hate the horror genre but due to the amazing story this game has it kept me on the edge of my seat and made me continue playing and ultimately finish it in one sitting.
 The price tag is worth it. This game is worth it. 10/10 would recommend.
