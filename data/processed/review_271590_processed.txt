The best game for me ever

yarrak gibi oyun

shity and long loading all the time

mdv,m

yum

Game won´t even start

nice game

yes

good

its just awesome

it be good for all 12 year

It is good for players who are mainly focused on the action part rather than the storyline because It is mainly based on gta online. But if you are looking for a good gta game with a good storyline I strongly recommend you to go for a game like GTA 4 as it has one of the best storylines after gta vice city and It`s graphics are still comparable to 2024s or maybe even 2025s standards.

This review is pointless considering it's a Rockstar game originally released in 2013. If you haven't played it, just play it.

this is my dream and it came true
 who wanna know how to download this without letting ask parents or steal money from somewhere or just beg somone to buy ask me i will get u the ans its soo easy

I have this game on xbox with nearly everything unlocked. I got all this before the game became extremely greedy. Starting a new account on PC because you can't transfer anything is genuinely cancerous. This game is hot garbage.

Pretty good game


It's now a classic.

me like me like lot

h

not fun really boring youll pay 2hrs max

I like this website


 when you can burn a potato on top of another potato then you must go go , because just no no.
are you a potato? no. this is why you are bacon, but will you be extra crispy just the way it's meant to be. 
if you could fetch any flavour sherbert from across the street. which would it even be?

Ničí mi to život. :)

really fun


its gta duh

Love this game

do  we need to say why?? lol. its the best

I've had the game for 3 days and haven't been able to play online once. I get kicked out every time i try to start an online session. Also you don't get money for the missions.

Just waiting for VI

good game to get fucked by flying nerds


best game on the market

In 3 years they still did not fix any issues or bugs...

Don't need to say much it Is absolutely amazing

this is the best game ever


Very good.

"GTA 5 is hands down the best game ever created! The graphics are absolutely stunning, every detail in the world is meticulously crafted. The gameplay is immersive, with endless opportunities for fun and excitement. From the gripping storyline to the dynamic online world, it offers a truly unmatched experience. The level of freedom you have is incredible, and it never gets boring. Whether you're cruising through the streets, pulling off epic heists, or exploring the vast open world, GTA 5 delivers on all fronts. No game even comes close to its brilliance!"

Let me know if you'd like to tweak it!

very good game

[h1]Grand Theft Auto V: The Game That Steals Your Free Time (And Maybe Your Sanity)[/h1]

Let’s talk about GTA V, the game that’s been around since the dinosaurs—or at least three console generations. Whether you’re a fan of heists, flying cars, or just punching random pedestrians for no reason, Grand Theft Auto V has something for everyone. It’s chaotic, absurd, and a little too good at sucking you into its madness.

[b][u]Story Mode: 9/10[/u][/b]
You’ve got three protagonists: Michael, the middle-aged guy having a mid-life crisis; Franklin, the guy trying to escape the hood; and Trevor, who is… well, Trevor. Their stories collide in a whirlwind of crime, betrayal, and explosive chaos. It’s like a soap opera with rocket launchers.

The missions are a rollercoaster of insanity. One minute you’re doing a simple repo job, the next you’re flying a helicopter while Trevor yells about something that probably isn’t legal. The story is gripping, hilarious, and just the right amount of ridiculous.

[b][u]Graphics: 10/10 (Except When You Mod It Too Much)[/u][/b]
Visually, GTA V still holds up. Los Santos is a sprawling, vibrant playground where you can admire the sunset—or crash a stolen jet into it. But let’s be real: most of us modded the game to oblivion, replacing cars with UFOs and turning every NPC into Shrek. At that point, it’s less "graphics" and more "personal fever dream."

[b][u]Gameplay: 10/10 (Infinite Chaos Edition)[/u][/b]
What can’t you do in GTA V? Rob a bank? Check. Fly a jet? Double check. Spend an hour driving like a law-abiding citizen only to lose it and plow into a hot dog stand? Triple check.

The sheer variety of activities ensures you’ll never get bored. And if you do, there’s always GTA Online—which is basically a giant sandbox of chaos, microtransactions, and griefers who only exist to blow up your personal car.

[b][u]Soundtrack: 9/10[/u][/b]
The radio stations are back, and they’re as iconic as ever. Whether you’re jamming to West Coast classics on Radio Los Santos or headbanging to some rock on Vinewood Boulevard Radio, the music makes every moment better. Even that time you accidentally drove into the ocean.

[b][u]Online Mode: 7/10 (Depending on Your Blood Pressure)[/u][/b]
GTA Online is a chaotic masterpiece. You can do heists, run businesses, buy a yacht you’ll never use, or just get blown up by some 12-year-old who saved all their allowance for a flying motorcycle. It’s fun, it’s frustrating, and it’s a constant reminder that capitalism is alive and well—even in Los Santos.

Pro tip: If you ever feel rich, visit the in-game store. Nothing humbles you faster than realizing you can’t afford that fancy penthouse without selling your virtual soul to Shark Cards.

[h1]GTA Roleplay: When Fun Turns Into a Heist (Against You)[/h1]

Ah, GTA RP, where people take Los Santos way too seriously. I joined a community, built a character, made friends, and thought, “Wow, this is great!” And then one of the leaders pulled the ultimate heist: stealing our money. Not in-game. Real money.

[b][u]Gameplay: 8/10 (Until Someone Robs You IRL)[/u][/b]
Roleplay is immersive, hilarious, and occasionally ridiculous. You’ll play a cop, a criminal, or that weird guy running a taco stand who somehow knows everyone’s secrets. It’s great—until you realize the real criminals are running the server.

Imagine grinding hours in-game, donating to support the community, and then waking up to find out the “leader” has vanished with everyone’s cash. It’s like a heist movie, except you’re the victim and there’s no satisfying third act.

[b][u]Community: 4/10 (Trust Issues Edition)[/u][/b]
RP communities are hit or miss. When it’s good, it’s amazing—people genuinely commit to their roles, and the stories are unforgettable. When it’s bad, well… let’s just say I learned the hard way that not everyone playing a shady character in-game is acting.

[b][u]Final Verdict for RP: 6/10[/u][/b]
GTA RP is a blast if you find the right community. Just do your homework before you start trusting anyone with more power than you. And remember, in the world of RP, the line between "roleplay villain" and "real-life scammer" is thinner than a Shark Card balance.

[h1]Final Thoughts: GTA V and RP Combined[/h1]
Whether you’re living out your chaotic fantasies in GTA V or diving into the unpredictable world of RP, this game gives you memories—some hilarious, some painful, all unforgettable. Just remember, Los Santos is a dangerous place, both in-game and out.

Final verdict for both: 9/10 for the laughs, 1/10 for the trust issues.

should rename this to: driving simulator with guns and drugs

Not only does this require a 3rd party launcher but also requires you to install BattleEye to play the single player game.  Kernel level anti-cheat are fine if you are going to play online in a competitive environment but should not be required for single player.

Best game ever!!


good


cool

good game

great gameplay

nice


best game really fun in free time

10/10 ruined my sleep schedule and I lost all my money gambling at the casino

homie

Very Good


very nice

bug cok

the game that everybody knows, the game that broke records, the game that has changed peoples lives and the game that shaped the internet. i remember one of my cousins let me play this game while i was at their house. i played as micheal. first thing i did was run around and bump into people and get ran over by cars, not knowing what to do. when i figured out how to shoot people, i took full advantage of that and shot everyone i saw. naturally, the police came, and i wasnt very good at games at the time since i was young, so i ran. they chased me all the way to the pier, and i tried to swim away but eventually died. even though i didnt know what to do, what the game was about, and had never played a game of the sort at the time, it was 100% the most fun id had on any other game. years later, id buy it on my xbox, and get days, probably weeks of gameplay time on there. shortly after my xbox had passed, id bought it on my pc, wanting to relive all of the experiences id had on my xbox. i dont have many hours on steam, but i have so many hours overall i wouldnt even begin to know how to calculate them. this is definitely my longest and most in depth review, so i think that tells people its worth the money, even though im sure everyones plently aware of that.

very nice game

hey com'on its gta! real good

still can't find the shoes in the shoe store. 1/10

Great Game...and timeless

I'm going to buss on my computer thanks Rockstar games.

‏“GTA V is one of the best open-world games I’ve ever played. The story is engaging, with three unique characters that bring their own perspectives to the game. The world of Los Santos feels alive, and there’s so much to explore—from the city streets to the countryside. The gameplay is smooth, and there are endless activities to keep you entertained, whether it’s missions, side quests, or just causing chaos in the open world. Plus, the online mode adds even more replayability. Highly recommended for fans of action and adventure games!”‏“GTA V is one of the best open-world games I’ve ever played.

Such a wonderful and thrilling game of my life 
#GTA 5 Public 🎮🤘🏻

Haven't played GTA since the beginning years ago.  This game is unbelievable.  I had high expectations but GTA V blew my high expectations away.  Amazed at the detail and complexity along with the vast open world content.  Impressive.

Best game I've ever played

It is really cool and i enjoyed it, but it will be better if we could play with Players on PS platform ^^

rockstar keep updating and fix the game which made the game still playable today although open really slow on new computers 9/10

Not very good


killed a hooker 10/10

Estupido juego todo buggeado

i watch the naked ladies!!1!!

The game hardly works. They added a anti-cheat that kicks me randomly when I'm playing normally. Modders still exist and ruin the games. The infinite loading screens are constant, I have to constantly fuck with the game just to load into online. It genuinely feels like the game does everything in it's power to get you to stop playing. Once you finally fucking get in it the grind is unreal. It's honestly more worth it to mod in money then to grind countless hours. After doing that the game can be fun, but only really with friends.

Invictus! Best game for 10 years!

nice game


good a game

chop

very fun cuz its just like real life but way better

I mean its GTA V what do you expect?

women

i like it


CFXB

Amazing game ! 😉 10 / 10 

However, Rockstar launcher is annoying. And Anti-cheat is useless.

What else can I say other than Rockstar should've focused more on the singleplayer/online map and what you can do in it. I feel like all they did was add a bunch of new vehicles, weapons, and clothes while completely neglecting the actual game. 

Honestly I hope GTA 6 will add more things to do, because literally I gave up on GTA 5 online back in 2016 because of how bland it was after you got everything. That was back on console, and I see how much this game "progressed" and all they did was add more vehicles, weapons, and clothes. Ffs Rockstar.

You can only drive around and cause chaos in the GTA5 map until you get bored with the base vanilla game and start modding the crap out of it. I swear the mods are the only reason I play GTA5, when in reality it should be Rockstar providing new things for people to look forward to.

They literally think "Oh, let's add a new heist, a new set of vehicles! Oh! Let's add another business for players to grind in!" I swear the only update I've seen where they actually added stuff for you to do in the map was the Casino, and literally all you do there is gamble or spin a wheel to get something. 

It's as if Rockstar doesn't know what the players want, so they just continuously milk the players of their wallets or force them to grind to be "invested" in the online GTA5. Meanwhile people are trying to find something fun to do, so they literally just do online competitions such as PVP, races, and etc. Or do the usual and kill other players around the map.

And guess what you get for all of it? More fictional money to continue the cycle of killing other players in the map or cause chaos with.

As I said, I hope GTA6 changes, because if they release a more polished GTA5 with no new things to do in it, I'll lose my mind with Rockstar. For over a decade of GTA5 being out, I've wanted to be able to have more stores to rob in the overworld, the ability to actually rob civilians to pawn the items I stole off of them, or stealing cars to go sell to some blackmarket place. 

You get the point, I don't need to list ALL of the things me and other players want out of GTA. Aka, GRAND THEFT AUTO.

Heists are fine, but once they are released for players to participate in, they get stale and boring. Just like the GTA 5 storymode missions. 

GTA should be about what you can do in the environment surrounding you, not go from point A to point B like it's some Call of Duty mission. You know GTA5 is boring when all you can do in the actually map is Missions, activities, kill people and steal their cars, be a straight up terrorist, and side missions.

Like, doing the whole chaos thing is fun, until you realize that's literally all you can do. I can go cause chaos in games like Postal 2 or hell even that one edgy game Hatred. But when I boot up GTA I expect there to be some chaos and violence, yes, but there should be CRIMINAL activities that you can do around the map. 

How can anyone be invested in this game when you don't feel like a criminal in a game that's supposed to be about being a criminal? Without mods to add more things to do in the game, it gets boring fast. Like what are all the 110 GBs this game adds to your computer for? The NPCs walking around that you can slaughter? If so, this isn't GTA, it's more like Postal 2 with better graphics and you can drive cars.

I know the excuse for there not being much in the map to do is because of "PS3/XBOX360 limitations", but this game has been out for 11 years now as of writing this. And it's pretty obvious Rockstar still releases "updates" for this game because they continuously add unnecessary missions, vehicles, and items. There really is no excuse for that.

It's like if I built one sand castle on a beach with a plastic shovel and said "I can't do anything else with this" and proceed to decorate the hell out of that one sand castle without even bothering to add more buildings or other sand castles. 

Nothing changes besides the one sand castle, and eventually you get bored with it and leave and all you got is that one sand castle. That's pretty much Rockstar with GTA5 in a nutshell.

As I've said, I'll continue playing the modded GTA5, but I refuse to play the vanilla/online GTA 5. It's just that boring and disappointing to even waste my time with. And who knows what GTA6 will have to offer, but I have a feeling they may just do the same to that as they've done with GTA5, which is of course milk it and neglect it.

I hope they aren't planning to do that, but we'll just have to see. 



gta

very good

It's a good classic game. Even if its old it would be nice to see a GTA 6 soon!

just bought the game and i can't play it anymore because it needs activation code which doesn't work

baking addicts when they take one day off: i gotta make some dough

GTA 6 on the way

fire

I like the arcade feel of the game which was a change from gta IV. Good story, characters, and fun in a lot of missions. Online was the right move since its a very fun experience with lots of things to do. PC port has some bugs here and there but not groundbreaking. Decent 9/10

Its GTA V

its good real fun

good

when gta 6 tho

ggwp

very great game. I got through the story weeks after i initially got the game. The game's a classic, simply good. The story is also quite nice. A little spoiler:Beating the game gives the main trio 19 million each.

You have to have incredible patience to play this game because of how long it takes to progress (in online) and how many infinite loading screen bugs there are. Other than that, and the aimbot AI, it's very fun. There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of activities to do around the map, easter eggs, game modes, etc.

FUCKING HATE THIS GAME HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WANT TO FUCKING KILL THE NIGGER WHO THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS A GOOD FUCKING IDEA. THIS IS FUCKING HORRIBLE IN EVERY FUCKING WAY POSSIBLE.

game is a loading screen simulator, most of the time when i try a mission or any activity, I'm trapped in a black screen usually for at least 15 minutes (upwards of 45+). unplayable and unacceptable for one the most profitable video games of all time

This is a fun game with friends or just by yourself, little tip if you play on PC expect to get moders in your game cause my first game was full of them and i have played in a single person server the entire time i play because it is unplayable in public.

From a Single Player perspective, the story and gameplay in general are great, even today. Though I am preferring Read Dead Redemption 2's gameplay, finding it a little harder to get back into GTA 5 after a few years.

Online I do play, but I hate the state of it atm with griefers and bored morons with cheats or too much money to do anything productive. Rockstar needs to get on top of this more. If they could have private lobbies that would be awesome so I can play with who I want or solo (though unfortunately heists are currently, for the most part especially early ones, for groups to complete).  I didn't get this game to play multiplayer which is a shame thats where they decided to take the direction of the game.

Overall though, game still holds up I guess

good game

best game

If you have not played gtav, buy it and play it, you will enjoy it. 
but where is gta6?

devin weston is an asshole

perfect

good

ehe qko!!!

god games

strip club required for 100% out of 10 :)

Best game ever.

love it nice to learn



This game has been ruined for every Linux player, and Steam Deck owners, despite GTA 5 being one of the most sold games on the Steam Deck.
It was my favorite game to play on it, i am now left with nothing.
Go fuck yourself, Rockstar, you became the exact company you make fun of in your game.

good fun

hbvgch


Been playing this game for a long time and have multiple accounts across the board, most of the time ur time will be spent fixing an issua with either people hacking ur game, losing connection in important moments like in missions. oh and the authentication process is very "weak". i have an old account with an old email that has been deactivated so no more playtime for that account because rockstar support will simply not be able to do a thing for you. Even after u spent all that miney and a whole lot of time trying to get all the things that make you feel like an "accomplished" player. 
If you have the spare time to invest into this game and the time to literrally wait days and even weeks for that one car that you really want, oh and lets not forget the broken economy, the old prices are still visible to old vehicles because if rockstar went all out and changed it right infront of the players face i dont think poeple would be turning theyre cheeks no more. this is a BUISNESS not a game, it once was now its just a life simulator where you can do anything u want as long as you invest 300 hours for items that dont even really exist.
And i hate to say this, i really do, but rockstar has passed all the players when it comes to being greedy.

Nigger's

Its GTA

very fun

pow pow cops n stuff


its fun and it has so much freedoom and its not realy a game where you you always have to comlet misons another reason why its cheaper then all the other games like this

We got GTA V before GTA VI

What happened Rockstar?
I spent 1000+ hours and hundreds of dollars on this game because I did enjoy playing GTAV, specifically GTA online. However, the game is slowly degrading due to its long-lasting bugs, past hacking issues, and the taking away of useful game features. But with Rockstar's recent decision to put in a new anti-cheat that prohibits me from playing the game simply because I don't use Windows I can no longer recommend playing this game.

I used to play this game almost religiously by myself or with my friends but now all I can do is play the single player. The single-player story is good don't get me wrong, but you can only replay it so many times. I would play FiveM servers if I could but guess what? Those also don't work with Linux users. overall I'm just unable to play the game mode I enjoy the most in this game.

As an act of protest even though I know it may not do much, Is first post this review and second not even bothering with this game anymore. nor any Rockstar game, even GTA Vl when it comes out. The constant jabs I see multiple companies take against people who use Linux are deeply concerning and upsetting. however, I am willing to come back to Rockstar if they would simply just allow people like me to play the game.

To sum everything up I'll say this. "My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined." -TheReportOfTheWeek / Reviewbrah

Great game. However their recent decision to remove steam deck support means i am incapable of playing it. I cannot recommend a game that intentionally alienates users from playing despite easy fixes being available


Balanced car physics, fun gameplay, fun missions, detailed city and ingame activities.



After many hours sunk into the online mode of this game, I am now unable to play this any more.
Since the decision to add BattEye Anti-Cheat, it is no longer playable on Linux.
Even though, BattlEye has support for Linux, they just need to implement it. Source: https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966

It's sad, because this game ran perfectly on the Steam Deck.
Big L for Rockstar.

The story mode in this game is great but Linux users can no longer play online because Rockstar hates everything and cute puppies. Now people on Linux who spent money on online mode just got scammed by greedy game company with basically all the money on earth. This is operating system bigotry

Good game, but definitely a love/hate relationship. Have owned it on PS3 since day one, then PS4 and then PC. Will probably have it on PS5 as well. Easily have 4000+ hrs on the game across all platforms. Online is fun with friends but a bit grindy, especially for new players. Still gets updates and the cheaters are finally mostly gone now.

Single player is polarizing because all support went to GTAO and that soured a lot of people, albeit modding single player is great. Even if T2 constantly makes it annoying to do so.

If you still don't own it, buy it. But wait for a sale.

Battleye made it unplayable, and it's not like we have less hackers. Just less legitimate players since now steamOS, Linux etc doesn't work without workarounds. Can't even launch single player without first installing Battleye and then adding a command line to not run it.

Grand Theft Auto V is widely regarded as an outstanding achievement in the gaming industry, seamlessly combining an engaging storyline, an expansive open world, and diverse gameplay mechanics. Despite certain controversial elements, the game has made a significant cultural impact and continues to attract millions of players worldwide.
Multiplayer Component
Grand Theft Auto Online serves as the multiplayer aspect of GTA V, offering players the opportunity to create unique characters and engage in an ever-evolving online environment. Within this space, players can undertake a variety of missions, participate in competitive events, and join in numerous activities. The game's enduring appeal is maintained through regular updates and expansions over the years.

GTAV and RDR2 will be the two greatest games by the OG Rockstar. 
Sadly after patches removing "offensive jokes" and protecting certain groups, Rockstar is a creative shell of its former self..
There is no soul at the company, only DEI cancer.
Just google the current R* team and pray GTA6 is not as bad as what people like them did to Saints Row.
I'm genuinely sad.
ROCKSTAR  died with Arthur Morgan.

I think this game is very neat, and some form of anti-cheat was definitely needed for GTAO, but making a seemingly deliberate choice to exclude Steam Deck users, and by extension, all Linux users from playing is real garbage, to put it politely

Deliberately lying about Steam Deck lacking support for BattlEye is real garbage too, as Battleye has had opt-in support through Proton since late 2021, several years before this anti-cheat was implemented store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966

Multiple developers have taken advantage, and Rockstar Games can do the same by contacting them, easy peasy

What's extra sad is that this anti-cheat has already been bypassed by many people, making it all for nothing it seems, yes.................. I'll update this review should things change, but for now I can't recommend this, unfortunately

The game is good but the launcher and DRM are annoying as hell, you can't just hit the launch button and play, neither you can be offline/ not have internet and play. This is like a whole lot of circus to just play a single darn game. I understand why young kids these days lean towards mobile gaming. 

It feels like you are punishing the buyer for paying money. This the first game I ever bought and it certainly isn't very tasteful.

Npcs intentionally crash into you when driving. It gets even more annoying when they have guns, they can shoot right at you through bushes and it could start from miles away with their backs on you. Not a fair game.

For every positive thing I could say about the game there's maybe 3 things that make me absolutely livid. The controls are impenetrable and seem to change in every context imaginable. Taking cover seems to have a 50/50 chance of not helping. The game has a bad habit of not explaining a context control I've been given until the last second. Driving is obnoxious because the AI always tries to crash into you, and is sometimes doggid to that end. There's a lot of things that could be menu driven but aren't, and what is menu driven is so poorly designed that I usually save time googling for what I'm looking for rather than finding it myself.

The single player's fine, whatever. Game has a nasty habit of putting me in slow, clunky vehicles and then expecting me to outrun the cops. I had a box truck explode on me once after escaping into the hills. Story is average. The characters suck: they're universally either whiny or irrational. Everyone, Trevor included, comes across as weak and passive because they usually just agree to do things for random strangers, friends, and each other without much argument, context, or promise of benefit. At one point I had a day-long internet outage at my home and I couldn't do some of the single player content because it required an internet connection.

The online world is a deluge of icons and options with barely any direction, so I have no idea what missions would be suitable to my inexperienced butt. There's a good chance that any content I try to interact with in the overworld will either drag me into a situation where I can't adequately defend myself without telling me first or just not work. My friends dragged me into the Cayo Perico heist so I could accumulate enough money to get a reliable income and, no joke, it was an hour of me just dying at the first second of combat and just watching my friends try and fail while IRL tapping on my phone in boredom. I'm pretty sure I could have gotten the same amount of money spending all that time playing the Fleca job over and over again. For Christmas, Rockstar made it so the entirety of Los Santos is covered in snow. OK, so first of all way to break the immersion of living in the sunny deserts of SoCal. Second, the snowfall produces constant rainy weather conditions so traction and turbulence are supremely awful. Third, the game's challenges don't factor the snow in. I gave up entirely after trying and failing for an hour at one of the flight school missions simply because the constant turbulence meant I had 0 input into my plane's movements and would reliably crash. I gold-starred the damn Helicopter landing challenge, ffs, so I know it's not me.

I wanted to give this game a try in anticipation of GTA VI to see if I might like it, and I suppose I have my answer as a resounding "No."

The requirement that you create a separate Rockstar account is bad enough. But if you can no longer access the old account, you will not be able to play the game again. This despite having all other proofs that you in fact own the game. I do not recommend purchasing any Rockstar product. Their support process is extremely convoluted and shows a marked lack of respect for the customer. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Story mode is good, online missions are also cool BUT online sessions are literaly UNPLAYABLE every single gta online lobby has ATLEAST in a server of 5 people ATLEAST if you get LUCKY ATLEAST 1-2 cheaters with god modes and ability to crash your game forcing you to restart your computer since the game locks you in and task manager window cant be opened meanwhile in a big lobby of 20 ATLEAST 2-4 cheaters will  be present while usualy its half the server that uses cheats, the experience is just TERRIBLE its UNPLAYABLE and the game either has no anti cheat and moderation or very little but i doubt even that. Rockstar you have let us all down, all of us but actualy nice work since around 60% or more of online players use cheats you are not letting them down and allow them to ruin the game for normal player base, keep up the good work on letting those cheaters ruin the game. Rockstar let us down dont forget that.

865 Hrs on this game now, excluding when I used to play this game also on xbox

Loved this game since day 1, still love it to this day, at least go on it once a week to see whats on sale and any new dlc's apartments, cars, weapons, ect... to buy and use, loads of good fun and time with friends on private servers

story mode is still really funny to play and enjoy

can recommend to all my friends if you wanna piss ass around or get some stress out from a bad day at work, or school, ect...

I'm frustrated about the news that GTA V will no longer be playable on Linux devices including the Steam Deck. The message that Linux user should switch to windows is not a solution and no linux user will do that. Linux is a small platform but when Game developer block Linux it will never growth.

Give Linux a chance Developers!

good story thats worth playing.

online is kinda 50/50
slightly rampant with hackers and griefers, money isnt hard to get but for a beginner its not too friendly unless you have a friend.
almost necessary to use a bug to be alone in servers to actually make money because of the griefers and hackers.
plenty of bugs and glitches that make people angry in several heists, but theres also alot of funny bugs.


story 8/10
online 5/10 for money grind
online 8/10 for fun with friends (they wont stop blowing my cars up)



[h2]Rockstar’s Final Act: A Triumph of Blunders[/h2]

The multiplayer was once the crown jewel of online gaming—before Rockstar sullied it with their obsession over pay-to-win schemes, reducing the experience to a shallow money-grab. For years, cheaters roamed unchecked, as if Rockstar couldn’t be bothered to lift a finger to address the chaos.

Now, as the game stumbles into irrelevance, they’ve finally added anti-cheat. But not as a saving grace—oh no. Instead, this belated patch breaks Linux compatibility, alienating a loyal faction of players who stood by them despite the game’s spiralling quality.

And here’s the pièce de résistance: Why now? This late-stage attempt reeks not of redemption, but of sheer indifference or, perhaps worse, deliberate sabotage. It’s the kind of decision that could only be dreamt up by a committee of apple polishers desperate to appear productive while ensuring their efforts accomplish nothing meaningful.

If Rockstar set out to exemplify mismanagement disguised as innovation, they’ve succeeded with flying colours. Bravo to the maestros of misstep for orchestrating such a symphony of disappointment.

Tried, but didn't like doing crimes. GTA5 required shooting police officers in the opening scene. Just couldn't do it. I'm glad shooting cops in Cyberpunk 2077 is completely optional.

dont get if on pc only griefers and bugs but xbox recomend highly

Easily the best game I've ever played. Too bad about all those modders and cheaters who ruin the game for others, and themselves.

GTA Online is a masterpiece and a must-have in your game library. With endless content, thrilling heists, and constant updates, it offers an unmatched, ever-evolving experience.

I’m can’t access to rockstar game launcher after 1 year not playing, and rockstar support is waste of time, terrible service, the worst experience ever had

GTA V is easily the best open-world game for PC. The map is huge, the story is great, and there’s so much to do—it never gets old.

Dont buy if you use Linux. they simply blocked Linux users from gta online, with fraudulent excuses for it at that, so you wont ever really be able to play anything but the story mode. Once again, rockstar fails to deliver any sort of reasonability in their rampage of a "game development". sucks that we cant sue them for basically revoking accessibility to a tremendous part of a game that we own and PAID for.

Good game with good graphics and stories

Garbage social club system, cant log into another account when i dont have access to the email i made when i was 10. very good game :)

This game is much more addictive than before lol so good everyone should play this game


I haven't grinded a game like this in such a long time. This game is super ahead of its time obviously and honestly for 14 dollars (got this on sale) this was a STEAL, i got my first ending which was [spoiler] Option C, Deathwish [/spoiler] and now I will try to get the other endings soon enough, this game is genuinely great and I am excited to see what comes with GTA 6 (if it doesn't get delayed)

genuinely what an experience, wow.

it is a very thrilling and exciting game which helps know of how life is.so it's giving you a picture of how life can be when you grow up for those ho are young.

It is a nice game but every time I play online, there are bunch of griefers. Also when doing a mission some vehicles are bugging out in the game. Every time. every single time I do a mission to supply the stocks in my bar, the supposed to be van that is carrying the supplies for the mission is bugged out. Both of the back of the wheels of the van are floating and cannot touch the ground making it unplayable for the mission. Most of the NPCs in the game are also bugging out probably because of the update. When NPCs drive a vehicle they don't adapt to the slippery of the road due to the said Christmas update making them crashed to each other and blocking the path of the Players mission also making the mission unplayable.

Was running fine on Linux for years, but now Rockstar suddenly decided to enforce Battleye AntiCheat without opting into Linux support. Consequently, online mode is unplayable and any progress is effectively lost.

you buy the game, u enjoy it
2. you start playing the game and finding friends
3. the friends were hackers
4. u killed the hacker
5. u got kick from the server

: )

> want to replay the story 
> must now sign multipage EULA that didnt exist at the time of the purchase
> anything other than a "yes daddy" blocks me from playing the game I paid for

They will do the same for GTA VI. I strongly recommend to acquire the soon to be pirated version. You want the current gaming trend to change? Hit them where is hurts them most: wallet and ego

GTA V is a masterpiece of chaos. One minute you’re meticulously planning a heist, and the next, you’re being run over by your friend because they “wanted to see if friendly fire works.” Spoiler: It does.

The story mode is fantastic, but let’s be real—online is where the real madness happens. Whether it’s launching cars off Mount Chiliad, getting into ridiculous shootouts with the police, or watching a random player in a flying motorcycle ruin your day, GTA Online is pure, unfiltered chaos.

And then there’s the economy: spend hours grinding for cash or just give up and buy a shark card so you can afford that golden yacht you’ll never use.

[b]Final Verdict:[/b] Highly Recommended, but only if you enjoy being trolled by 12-year-olds in jetpacks.

I lost everything, my entire online account was reset. I used this account as a 100% legit play through (no glitches or mods), yet my account was reset. Restarting really is not as bad as I thought it would be, using the Freakshop and Dax missions to get the acid lab, it is an amazing source of income at a very low level.

supper buggy if inter is bad but really fun with friends

One of the best game in the gaming community it's  my childhood  dream play this game after year's i finally  able to play this game! any how this game graphic,storyline when it comes about Rockstar  game's  no words my next game will be RDR after completing  this game!.

i like sometimes but sometimes rockstar is retard so sometimes no fun but i like dicking down my friends with fire work launcher

this is the very nice game i recommend this game, and i love it even when i dont make main quest
and i listen still dre there

GANGSTA GANGSTA

Great game, sometimes i don't know what you have to do in GTA V Online, and there does not seem to be many activities for less than 8 people at a time, which i only have one other person to play with. but, the campaign, is still legendary, and it's overall a fun experience

usually only play on pc for story mode mods, but still gta is a golden gem and i cant wait for gta6 to come out

I have played GTA Online for 105 hours now, It is fun-ish. it has some bugs and the damage system is kind of broken. but this is all covered when playing with friends, I just now did Cayo for the first time and it was a pain in the ass, but we got through it and got a decent payout. but we had fun, If you plan on buying GTA and you see this. if you have friends that own GTA or have the money. Please talk them into buying and you will see how much funner it is

this games really good and the mods for it are amazing story mode wise

Just got around to playing the tutorial, it has been fun! I am looking forward to the rest of this game.

Always love supporting indie developers!

The game itself is fun, but their reliance on gta online and sharkcards have honestly ruined the game for me.

Its a shame too since there are alot of cool mission ideas in online, but with the grindy gameplay loop, griefing, and poor online performance, it feels like everyone would've benefited if they put those ideas into a singleplayer dlc, instead of a online mode that will eventually shut down

Someone linked my steam account to Rockstar Social Club, making it unplayable. Do not buy. This is a common issue for other people too

GTA V, probably one of the best games I've played with a GREAT story line. As someone who has almost 1000 hours on PS5, this game is really good, and I'd be surprised if you thought it was bad. (Why is premium edition cheaper than the full game?)

for 96 hours on gta v and online i legit go to my wife quoting michael and franklin quotes  too them during sex tho i must say gta iv is way better then v

Shank Man, Shoot up school, Run from police, Hide in bush, Commit Tax Evasion, Repeat.
10/10

I have this game on xbox with nearly everything unlocked. I got all this before the game became extremely greedy. Starting a new account on PC because you can't transfer anything is genuinely cancerous. This game is hot garbage.

the story in the single player mode is good but when I play the online mode I whant ot throw my pc out of my fu***ng window

I'm so sick and tired of how difficult this game has become and how it robs you.

The game is impressively built with the graphics, but the bugs have obliterated the fun. 

There are some maps with glitches that destroy your chance of completing a mission by either hiding things you have to pick up or making you stuck to where you die trying to play. The people from this studio clearly have no idea how to fix things and they've built the game to discriminate against you if you don't have a friend to play with. After you work really hard to build an inventory to sell and make money in-game from, the game forces you to deliver it all with less time than it takes to actually make a delivery. For example, to deliver $800k in weapons, the game forced me to deliver two trailers across a 30 minute map in only 20 minutes before the game burned $400k of my hard earned funds.

I just finished an air source mission where you were expected to bomb a tug boat and somehow not get shot up in the process by the 20 people down below. My plane was shot down, I exausted my healing and anti-helicopter equipment because of random air attacks that came at me while I was swimming for my life. I finished this 20 minute mission with barely 2 minutes left. Rockstar's idea of Christmas is apparently to blind you at night with snow so you'll fly into the water. After swimming for 10 minutes, I made it to a mountain blocked shore where the sand and rocks were glitched with my character tip-toeing to safety because of bad game design making my feet glitch through the ground OF ROCKS.

At my nightclub I built a stock of $100k in inventory to sell and when starting the mission, I progressed to the point of picking up a cargobob helicopter to lift the van carrying the lot. Immediately after a tedious 30 seconds of the heli hook picking up the van (somehow, despite physics), white holding down both the right trigger and the left wheel up (forward and up) both cargobob and van flew straight into the ocean, FAILING the mission and burning the money I waited for 6 hours in real life to build up.

None of this is to mention how Rockstar virtually tells you nothing about what you're supposed to do in various situations. When you start an excess weapons supply mission from your bunker, there are a group of 6 enemy vehicles that come at you in pairs. I had to discover by trial and error that this wasn't infinite. Up to this point, I was being thrown off the road and killed numerous times trying to avoid what I was left to assume was an infinite threat. 0 WARNING FROM ROCKSTAR.

The game is a masterpiece visually and with the audio, but the mechanics are just terrible. People who are on the developer team need more accountability and better planning so this game doesn't basically rob its players of their limited lifetime.

So many endless possibilities to do in Los Santos and Sandy Shores. My friends and I spend our time doing chases down in Sandy Shores and Grapeseed, trying to kill the runner's car with our vehicles.

very good i advise u to go to the shoe store best place in the game enjoy

Singleplayer is the best, dont play Online is very bad

Great game, great story just the retarded kids that come and kill you in multiplayer that are annoying asf

it is an extrordinarily good singleplayer game

just stay away from the multiplayer as far as you possibly can and you will have a great time

Account wiped randomly. nothing good about online since its full of hackers and script kiddies

Combined i have about 1200 hours on this game, mainly on GTA online, in all honesty GTA:O has remained my favorite game experience, although buggy, full of hackers, becoming a micro transaction horror, just driving around Los Santos relieves all my stress i've had accumulated. Just put on your favorite song and have fun. The game is 11 years old but it holds it's grounds.
