at octopus boss.it so hard to aim the cannon .because no crosshair.please fix

after playing 4 hours we can no longer sync and play together!

i love playing with my husband (he's so bad at the mini games I always win fr)

Not quite completed it yet, but it's been a quality, varied two player coop experience.
Lovely visuals, snappy fluid response, a new mechanic for each section of the story (replaces the previous one, rather than being a mounting stack to keep in mind). This does mean that the challenge is moderate, not super difficult anywhere, but imo not overly dumbed-down either.

There's more in the way of story than I'd realised when I bought it, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment, and the areas you progress through complement the storytelling well. The between-play parts don't outstay their welcome.

Poor play-testing I suppose. I bought this game and played it with the friend-pass feature with my GF (great concept this friend-pass btw). We had to repeat the first-level about 3 times, twice we got stuck in the slide at the end of the tutorial (right before you catch the third fuse) and once because the multiplayer connection broke. About 1.2 hours in we arrived at the first boss fight (the vacuum). For some reason after several attempts the boss broke at 25% hp. Its phases broke, skipping our damage-doing phase making progress impossible. Through-out our experience we experienced quite some lag, the cut-scenes were of poor-quility due to the lag and the was a lot of de-synchronisation between our devices (for example, my gf was standing still on my screen for 20+ seconds, while she was doing something.) Overal our experience was not great and i have requisted a refund.

Very beautiful game with a lot of cinematic choices and references :)

I really liked this game a lot at first. My partner and I had a great time solving the puzzles together until we had to torture and murder a poor little elephant pleading for her life. That shouldn't have been part of the game what the heck.

Played this game with my long distance girlfriend, it gave us hours of fun on our first play through. The game play was great, wish we could have fought the book though.  We revisited it after we got engaged to get that 100% and it was still just as fun to get into hi-jinks again

I played this with someone who has a lot of patience to deal with me. I never felt pressure with that person and I must say I bickered with him too because this person teased me so much lol. 10/10 tbh. Also I always thought I'm always gonna be a pushover until someone who teases me while playing this game would push my buttons lol.

The Game is Fantastic~ <3 

Specially Thanks to My Bunbun~ <3 <3 <3
Couldn't Done it or Even Play the Game without Her~ <3 


Pretty great co-op games. One of the best out there. I've been playing with my bf and we both enjoy the different adventures.

It is straight-up one of the most creative co-op games out there. Every chapter feels fresh, and it’s perfect for laughs or yelling at your partner. Easily one of the best games to play with someone! 💗

It Takes Two is an incredible split-screen multiplayer game that requires collaboration and teamwork on a level that truly fits the co-op game genre. It features a great atmospheric soundtrack, lively and realistic voice-acting, a believable story, challenging, original and fun themed levels, mini-games and really is a labour of love. Wonderful game 9/10, only taking off a point for the controls not working sometimes.

extremely fun game with friends/family with varied boss fights and unique mechanics for each stage

One of the best co-op games, each stage has different game mechanics which makes the experience different. highly recommended to play with your Girlfriend, friends or family.

I had this game in my wishlist since its release and finally bought it this year to play with my partner. It Takes Two has surpassed all my expectations in terms of story, gameplay, and overall fun. Look forward to completing the game!

beautiful game with a nice adventure and fun gameplay

probably the best 2-play co-op game ever made. I 100% recommend to every couple/friend duo i know. incredibly easy to understand and it slowly gets more difficult throughout, but not too difficult to not be able to complete.

  A very interesting family game, at least 10,000 times more fun than the AstroBought. I went throught customs with my friends. In my opinion, this game has the following adventages and disadventages.
  Adventages:
    Interesting level desgin, and there are two people, which adds unexpected fun to you: Maybe they don't like each other, or they have a tacit smile.
  Disadventages:
    The process is not very long, and there is a huge historical problem that the required configuration is too high (not a real drawback).

I always thought this got game of the year because it was just easy for people to understand and it never looked that fun to me. I was wrong. This is genuinely one of the best games I've ever played and I hardly even play story games.

We finished recently It Takes Two and I was very surprised with the level designs, the different mechanics that suited each chapter theme and the progression of the pair in the story. I think struggles arise when one of you is noticeably better at general gaming than the other. I'm definitely a bit better at tasks that require precision timing, but overall we're mostly on par.

This is a great game to play with a friend... or especially a significant other. Colla-bo-ra-tion! :D

yes so gud i recommend this game, no more netflix n chill, we do It Takes Two n chill <3 :3

turns out this game is perfect for grown ups who had parents issues too, and not only for couples.

CINEMA

it was very awesome ,Me and me friend was laughing during our gameplays.

What an experience! Played through the entire thing in one weekend. Can't speak highly enough about it.

Wanted to wait and play with a significant other. Instead choosing to play with my Friend. Really fun game was not expecting to enjoy it so much. by the end of it we were kissing.

I played this game with my 10 year old son during christmas season. Was a lot of fun and also a good story

I played this game first with my husband and we LOVED IT. For one, it was a cute story that we were really invested in. And two, the ART STYLE is just so fun. 

I also really appreciated how all of the missions and challenges were different and gave a good variety of play styles and challenge types. It made the game seem much less boring and repetitive. Not to mention the random mini games available through out the game was so fun to discover! My husband and I would play them a few times before moving on with the game because they were so simple and cute lol.

Overall, the cooperative nature was also really well done as well as each character had different skills they would use which made it nice for us to pick our characters when we played in case one of us was a better driver and the other a better shooter lol.

I love how accessible this game is for my girlfriend who has never played games but is still fun for me when I've spent my whole life playing games. The level of creativity and detail in this world is so beautifully crafted and deserves every bit of praise this game receives. The story, the puzzles and the COLLABORATION in the game is so fresh and enjoyable to play; unless you can't appreciate a relaxing experience or don't have someone to play this game with, this is absolutely a game you should play.

Fire Boy and Water Girl but with more mechanics and real world... and wood and stuffing

good story, good gameplay, very nice visuals and good voice acting.

The story is great, personally I found the later levels/stages/sections to not be as fun as the beginning, but all in all, it is a fun and great little game ^^

Wonderful and unique game for friends or couples to play. Amazing emotional storyline and certainly  worth the money.

This is an awesome game! Perfect game to play with the close ones. Not too complicated gameplay but still introduces very interesting features. For those who in douts, I totaly recomend the game.

It Takes Two" is an extraordinary gaming experience that surprises and engages in unique and innovative ways. Playing it, I found myself immersed in a cooperative adventure that’s not only entertaining but also delivers profound messages through a well-crafted and touching narrative. What I truly loved about It Takes Two is its ability to foster genuine cooperation. The game’s mechanics are designed to ensure that both players feel equally involved, with unique abilities and tasks that require constant communication and synchronization. It’s not just about beating the levels but learning to work together in ways that feel meaningful and rewarding. Visually, the game is stunning, with a whimsical art style that brings its fantastical world to life. The sound design and voice acting are equally top-notch, enhancing the immersion at every turn.

I never thought i would be THIS pleased with the game but this is insane. This game has EVERYTHING. Visuals are amazing , most minigames are fun , the adventures are amazing every chapter is unexpected and brings something new to make it engaging. 
Excellent.

This is a very good game. The graphics are great and there are many levels to progress. Family friendly.

Loved the game, but I can't seem to finish it because the Friend1 I play with is not available most of the time. The Friend2 who I wanted to play with doesn't have enough storage. It'd be cool if I can play Solo XD. Guess I'll just wait til I meet Friend3 or a special someone who I could play this with. Once I finish the game, I'll consider buying Split Fiction. 

My fault that I don't have more friends to play this with XD and making it seem like not worth my money, but oh well...

very fun and interesting BEFORE U PLAY FIND  A GOOD FRIEND NOT A DUDE WHO HAS NERVE PROBLEMS AND PLAYS GOOD!

I was clear this game on ps5 but still bought it on steam again.
Honestly, this game made with love and creativity.

Very fun with friends, some puzzles confused us but we did them in the end, its really fun and i do recommend it

This game is soooo fun to play with friends. Graphics, mechanics and every aspect of this game is amazing. Hope they make a it takes 3!

This was fking insane.
Took us 12h to beat but every single one was definitely worth it.
I can only wish for most games to be a fraction as creative as this game.
If you have a buddy to play this with. PLZ PLZ PLZ play it.
Rare EA W imo
Final Rating: 11/10

Can not rave enough about this game, fantastic story, level lay outs, cooperative challenges, themes, art. Everything about it screams an amazing title and a fantastic time. Grab a friend, play through it, then grab another friend and do it again. You'll want to. Need a friend? Ill play with ya.

Love that game directors dgaf attitude lol. My friend and I played through this game twice, amazing visuals, great story, and COLLABOOOORATION!!! Can't wait for Split Fiction.

Super nice game to play with my family. I have started a game with my son and my daugther and they both loved the game.

Absolute masterpiece. Great gameplay, great graphics, fun, and caused lots of high fives.

This game was beyond beautiful, very happy to have played it with my own partner and excited for Split Fiction to come out !!

After having played it, I can confidently say that this game getting Game of the Year in 2021 was well deserved. The fact that only one person needs to own this for two people to play it is brilliant, and it can be played both online and locally if you have a controller. I honestly wish more game companies did something like this.

I have played both A Way Out and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, both previous projects of Josef Fares, both of those also excellent in their own right, so I had an idea of what I was getting into with It Takes Two, but it still managed to surpass my expectations. The sheer creativity and imagination on display in this game is breathtaking to say the least. There are so many things to do, not just in terms of the main game, but also a cavalcade of mini-games to play as well, including a tower climbing puzzle and a FULL set of chess!

The game takes you across many different parts of a small countryside house, including the shed, the attic, and the garden, and it presents you with a variety of different gameplay elements that keep surprising you at every turn, ensuring that the game never gets boring. It's also one of the game's best strengths that every new gameplay element is easy to understand from the introduction, and they all require teamwork between the two players in interesting and novel ways.

Both players can see everything from both players' perspective, as the game is divided down the middle like a split-screen game, which allows it to be played locally AND online, and it also allows people to communicate about things only they can see by referring to their own screen, which is nice. It can be a bit confusing for audiences, though, in case you want to stream this to friends, or want to play it on a TV with people in the room.

The game takes about 10-11 hours to complete, more if you want to be a completionist, and not one single one of them is wasted. The cutscenes are well acted, the set pieces are beautiful, the music is great, especially during the sequences that focus on sound (I'm keeping it vague as to not spoil), and the story is well written and really tucks on your heartstrings. The pair of parents you play as feel believable in their marital struggles, and the therapist book that follows you around and forces you through various couples-therapy exercises is hilarious in his own eccentric way. He's grating at first, but he grows on you over time.

An absolute recommendation from me, no doubt about it.

Wow wOw WOW. So such to say...this game is BEAUTIFUL. The creativity and imagination here is way off the charts. Fun, creative, funny, mind blowing, smart, inspiring, artful, amazing. I feel I could describe it for an hour. Play with a good friend and you'll have a blast. 

The storytelling is amazing, the game play is perfect, the pacing is feels good. Pixar couldn't have done such am amazing job.

It Takes Two is an amazing game that deserved its Game of the Year win. It’s the best co-op game out there, especially if you’re playing with a loved one. The story of Cody and May, navigating their relationship, perfectly matches the teamwork needed to solve fun and creative puzzles together.

The mini-games are a great touch, adding some friendly competition to the mix. Whether racing through challenges or battling it out in quirky arenas, these mini-games are a perfect way to spice things up and share some laughs with your partner.

Overall, It Takes Two is a heartwarming and fun adventure that’s all about teamwork, making it the perfect game to enjoy with someone special!

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
the puzzles are cleverly designed, its really enjoyable to work together in unexpected ways

10/10
highly recommended for its innovative gameplay, charming story, and stunning visuals

Do you want trust issues? Then 10/10 would definitely recommend. (Not for couples, you might get divorced just like the characters)

A perfect game to play with friends and family, my big sis love it even though she never like playing video games, puzzles are not too hard but sometimes still make us struggling, it's really fun when you finally figure it out XD

Completed it twice with the wife. My wife hates gaming. If she likes it, it must be next level, and it is.

un juego simple, pero bonito en su estetica... preferible el couch-coop, mas que por internet.

Absolutely BEAUTIFUL game that took me and my bud 11 hours to complete. Genuinely so many good ideas and mechanics that always kept us looking forward to the next session. I HIGHLY recommend this game to play with your friend.

I just sat down and did an entire play through of this game in one sitting with my fiance, it was surely an experience to cherish. Never before have I played such a game, it was perfect beyond words.

Damnit this game so good idk why i enjoy it with my gf, 14 hours play time like damn so fast, and most likely the visual we got it's damn entertaining

This game is an absolute masterpiece. Just buy it—you won’t regret it! It’s incredibly fun and lovely, with such an amazing message. The characters are super cute and full of personality, and the whole game is just adorable. The tasks are so creative and well-designed—it’s honestly impressive how they came up with such cool ideas.
The only downside is that the game isn’t very long—it took me about 15 hours to finish—but it’s totally worth the experience. I really hope they release a sequel or add some updates because I wish it was longer. The controls are fantastic, and everything about this game is so well done. Huge congrats to the developers—high five and peace! ✋✌️ 😊

Great game, story, visual effects, immersion etc... seriously nothing to gripe about at all when it comes to actually playing.

I will say we bought one copy on sale for $7.99 and used the friends pass for the other copy and that felt perfect. I'd be pretty underwhelmed paying $40 full price for this experience.

9/10. Absolutely amazing ride! The lessons the characters learned and the touching story were incredible. I will 100% be playing it a second time. The first time, I played with a friend; we pretty much beat the game in one sitting and had a blast messing around with mini-games and joking about the characters. For my second playthrough, I’ll be playing with my girlfriend, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing the game again.

Would recommend

idk how i've never played it its literally the only game that has that many mechanics and 1000s of scenarios wow wtf

Sensitivity keeps changing, button prompts keep changing, swinging on a rope goes from tapping to holding to tapping again. The platforming is awful and the story is vapid.

It’s fine?

The co-op aspect is decent and it’s fun to play splitscreen where you can see the other screen to time things. Playing on an internet delay for specific timing stuff is rough though. The general movement mechanics were really good and I liked how they switched from power to power to keep things fresh. That being said, the first ones were the best and the rest were mostly just fine. Mechanically it’s sound and I think they extracted the most out of the coop aspect.

The story is about as subtle and nuanced as a brick to the face. However, there are a few scenes that do hit hard. The first half progresses well with a goal but then you get a surprise second half that I really think could have been cut down. Generally I think the game could have used a bit of trimming and tightening to not have a lot of just dead time. The vistas are expansive and imaginative but some of the levels just drag showing you every corner. 

Oh the game looks fine but I was getting massive frame drops at points. Couldn’t tell if the game was poorly optimized or just some issues with internet lag. 

[spoiler]It’s a personal gripe because I’m miserable but having some subtlety by saying Hey! It’s OK that folks are growing apart. It’s not the end of the world. That would have been nice and the ending of reassuring their kid that it’s not her fault and they still love her would have worked still.[/spoiler]

even after three years the game still Magnificat , Breath Taking .........

It is good to play once, like I did with my girlfriend. However, if you are autistic, you will not be compelled by the story. The characters will seem one-dimensional, and the growing affection over the story will not be convincing at all. 

The gameplay is good (if a bit janky), but there are lots of "filler" cinematic events that make it seem rather style over substance, especially given the limitations of the Unreal Engine. Potato computers should stay far away!

I hope that fucking book gets the 1933 Germany treatment.

great game, although a bit more difficult than we thought it would be. Wife approves.

Amazing game for a wife or girlfriend or child or younger sibling; basically anyone who is not attuned to platforming games can learn hassle free with this one granted you have someone else who DOES know what their doing and can guide the other. Very fun for my wife and I to play :)

It Takes Two is a brilliantly crafted co-op adventure game developed by Hazelight Studios. It focuses on Cody and May, a couple on the brink of divorce who are transformed into dolls and must navigate a magical world to mend their relationship. The game stands out for its innovative mechanics, engaging narrative, and stunning visuals, all while providing an exceptional multiplayer experience.

From a gameplay perspective, "It Takes Two" keeps players on their toes with constantly evolving mechanics. Each level introduces new abilities that require cooperation between Cody and May. For instance, Cody's ability to rewind time and May's ability to clone herself are utilized in tandem to solve intricate puzzles and overcome obstacles. This continuous introduction of fresh gameplay elements ensures the experience remains dynamic and enjoyable.

The story is both heartfelt and humorous, centered on Cody and May's journey of reconciliation. Their relationship is explored with sensitivity, making the characters' journey feel authentic and engaging. The inclusion of Dr. Hakim, the quirky love book with his exaggerated antics, adds a layer of comic relief, balancing the more serious moments of the narrative.

Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. Its vibrant and imaginative art style brings various fantastical environments to life, from lush gardens to snowy landscapes. The detailed environments and charming character designs are complemented by excellent sound design. The voice acting is superb, delivering emotional performances that enhance the story, while the soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and whimsical tunes that fit perfectly with the game's mood.

Designed exclusively for co-op play, "It Takes Two" excels in its multiplayer experience. The split-screen format, even when playing online, ensures both players are always engaged and in sync, fostering constant communication and teamwork. This focus on collaboration is its greatest strength, making it an ideal game to play with a friend or partner.

The attention to detail in "It Takes Two" is remarkable. Every level is packed with interactive elements and hidden secrets that reward exploration. The developers have meticulously crafted each environment, ensuring players are constantly rewarded for their curiosity. The small details, like character banter and whimsical enemy designs, add depth and charm to the overall experience.

In summary, "It Takes Two" is a triumph in cooperative gaming. Its innovative mechanics, engaging story, stunning visuals, and excellent sound design make it a standout title. The game provides a genuinely collaborative experience that is both challenging and rewarding, making it a must-play for anyone seeking a memorable co-op adventure.

Nice idea, good to relax. It always tries to show you something new. Just a bit too long.

First off, you need a partner🙂. 
The puzzles are not brain burning, they're very enjoyable.
Exploring around the map isn't dry nor boring AT ALL. 
The large amount of small interact-able things around the map, adds even more fun to the game.

Additionally, there are many references in the game (Street Fighter Series, Diablo Series, etc), which I find incredibly cool.

Simply an amazing experience, played with my girlfriend and had a shit ton of fun, recommending to play specially with your partner

Clever level design and fun puzzles. Loved the game. Definitely worth for 80% off. Best part is only one of you has to buy the game to play coop.

Such a fresh game with great snappy mechanics. Played it twice.

I rate this game a 7/10 and here is why. This game is good, it really truly is my biggest gripes are the controls are bad and thankfully you can rebind them which I suggest because sprint on CAPS is abysmal, but also sometimes myself and my partner who played together on separate systems had trouble getting the aiming to work during shooting sections, hit boxes were weird during certain fights and personally the book character doesn't add much to whats going on. That being said the story overall is funny, cute, sad, wholesome and gut-wrenching. You'll definitely have moments where you will intentionally kill you friend because it's funny and there's so many different scenarios where it can just as easily be a mistake which adds to the humor. There's lots of small Easter eggs sprinkled throughout in the form of mini-games, dialouge, secrets and animations. Definitely worth a try.

Just finished this w/ my partner and cannot recommend this more. Minus the [spoiler]elephant scene[/spoiler] not ever being addressed this was a 10/10 experience.

Absolute beauty of a game. Perfect from start to finish, loved the story.

I originally was skeptical on this game winning game of the year. I didn't imagine that it could possibly beat out the other games to compete against. But after downloading and playing this game with my partner, I can say with full confidence that this game is truly a masterpiece. 
This game holds the perfect amount of funny witty comments, mixed with heartfelt moments, as well as moments that even left me tearing up.
This game is everything and more, and deserves everything, this game helped strengthen my bond with my partner as well as being one of the most beautifully told story games I've ever seen. 
This game is worth it.

One of the best couch co-op that I have played recently. Fun to play, definitely recommend

Good game. Played it with a lad for lore purposes only. Do not get the wrong idea

very well worth it game, good story telling, probably helping to strengthen the relationship?

Such a whole fun journey, i get it for free and play it for fun

This game has won the GOTY for a reason. Thank you to the developers for this masterpiece. Looking forward to play their next release Split Fiction.
I played this with my friend and we laughed in every level and were both amazed by mechanics and beauty of the world the developers have created. I highly recommend to buy a copy (during sale ofc) and play it with your friends/lovers/family.
*Just remember that you only need 1 copy of the game: the other person can join your game for free.

A really fun and cute game to play with a friend or partner. Highly recommend :)

Absolute masterpiece of a game. Each time I thought I knew what to expect, I was more than pleasantly surprised with new game mechanics being introduced, insane story elements, and just amazing gameplay. I could not recommend this game enough.

The story line for this game is great.  I have laughed,  cried, and screamed.  Best game I've played in awhile.

Great Game
The magic book of love it fucking annoying in cut scenes

It's fun, only problem for me is that it was clearly made for people who don't usually play games so it feels a little too easy, but even then its a very nice experience, and it's very begginer friendly. So if you are looking for a little enjoyment and a cozy game to play with a friend or partner, I'd totally recomend it.

Overall the game is pretty good. The stages are different enough to be not repetitive and the minigames are a nice change of pace and all of them are really enjoyable. The plot of the game is really interesting and made me feel bad for the daughter. The only downsides are that you can't skip cutscenes and the game at the end seems to stretch out more than it should have.

There are SOOOO many video games in this one video game it's difficult to even keep up with everything this game had to offer. 

Mechanics in one level that could've easily been stretched out into an entire game are consistently swapped out with whole new sets of abilities and worlds to explore. 

It's unrelentingly fun. 

The only thing that bums me out about this game, is the story. 

On the surface, It's fine. But, it could've been so much deeper. 

I just hope Hazelight can get some real great writers for their future projects.

I loved to play this game with my girlfriend, I was the first game we played together and we cannot wait to play Split Fiction.

one of the best story experiences of my entire life, i could not recommend this game enough

Played this with my Fiance over the course of two weeks. She is not what you would call a "video game person" but it was very easy for her to pick up and very hard for her to put down. The game is excellent in in many ways and tells a quite beautiful story. Highly recommended especially if you have a partner you'd like to introduce to your hobby.

I love how they keep gameplay dynamic and interesting! The squirrel scenes were amazing, especially aboard the plane.
