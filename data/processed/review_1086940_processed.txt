A wonderful game. If you like dnd or just turn based battle games with a bunch of story then this is perfect for you!

iT'S GREAT

this game is too much fun

best game in a while innit

It's okay I guess

One of the best games i played since i was a kid, so much is packaged all into this game. These devs did a wonderful job in making the game have many outcomes and variables and different ways to play the game. This is now a blueprint for future games to come.

Absolute cinema.

:)

Nuked some Gith with 2 Smokepowder bombs, 10/10.

One of the best games I've ever played.
Over 300 hours for the first run, and there wasn't a single boring moment.
Thank you for creating such an amazing game!

Fantastic.

ITS GOOD

Apparently I had forgotten to write a review for this game...

It's amazing. Buy it.
That's all there is to say.

Incredible game for any TTRPG fan or any Baldur's Gate franchise fan. The combat mechanism is really fun and the dialogues are rich.

BG3 is a great game. It allows for true RP (role playing). You can fully customise your character and live any fantasy you can imagine within the given game setting. The story is original and fun and you are the one who is directing it with the actions you decide to take. You can be good, or evil, or any mix. You can date different races and genders and explore things you would never do in real life.

Just buy it

<3

one of the best games ever made and maybe even best studio behind it too

Crazy amount of content. Took me 113hrs to complete and I feel like I did 80% of the side quests. Cool how your decisions influence the path you take.

10/10 best game ever

If you have over 100 hours of free time, this is it, look no further.

love bear sex

What more can be said, that hasn't been said already? This game is great!

Goty of 2023 and will be for a long time.

Do i need to say more

Fun time with friends

.

:D

Big fan of BG1 and BG2 here. I played both games multiples times in the past, it's one of my favorite games ever!!

After playing the DOS series I had a feeling that Larian would deliver something amazing and they did. This game is a masterpiece, a work of art!!! I loved the full turn-based combat, it's challenging but rewarding. Each battle is unique and requires strategy even though there are multiple ways to win the combat.

The story is deep, this is one of the best writing I have seen in a video game. Different people with different motives where you are the one making your own story. There's no wrong choice, there's your choice. Player freedom at its finest!!

If you are a RPG fan don't miss this game, it won many awards for a reason, IT IS A GREAT GAME!! For me this is the game of the decade. It is a game that I will play many times in the future.

Thanks a lot Larian, I can't wait to see what you are cooking next :))

Best game ever made so far, thanks Larian for this masterpiece!!

The Honor Mode challenge is incredible. It drove me to learn various ways to play the game. I lost so many honor mode runs, a couple handfuls of them before even getting to Gale. It would make me rethink and rework my strategy for my next run. Obtaining the golden dice became an obsession. Taking a break from achievement hunting now to play some other titles. Can't being myself to uninstall this one, and find myself often planning my next run.

The GOAT.

I played through the entire game multiple times in a row, which I have never done before. I loved it so much. Wish I could erase the game from my mind and play it for the first time again.

Wow so buggy (Mac Version). And impossibly hard at time - almost all combat is fatal.
WTF were these developers thinking. Game of the year, sure if your a drunken idot

The best game in terms of choice making

Will I finish this game? Eventually yes, turns out I'm obsessed with creating characters and trying every one the million options presented to me in the story...

This game allows you to be whoever you want to be, rich story driven narrative, where EVERY choice matters. Captivating backstories for your companions and other NPCs...

No wonder it won GOTY, also no microtransactions, no paid DLCs, this is a gamer's wet dream...

I threw a goblin at another goblin and then got a dog, gr8 game.

I love this game 😭

I never buy Games full price. This time i did..... and i think I paid not enough for what I got.

0 Grind
0 micro transactions

100% sure that I missed something  and looking forward for the next game

Once in a generation Game.... (happy if I´m wrong)

ok

Amazing game! I'm blown away by the sheer possibilities and choices that you have.

Not most to say other than that it is the most fantastic game I have ever played

Monster mommy dating simulator

Best role game ever

At this point the words of praise for Larian and bg3 have been sung far and wide I just came to toss my thumbs up onto the pile.

It's more or less what i expected from Larian after DOS2.
One of the best games of all time.

It's a good game :)

Ending had me overwhelmed for a week, 10/10

horray killing and porn!!!

10\10 theres a reasson why it won game of year, its DnD as a video game, if you like DnD go for it.

.

They got J. Jonah Jameson in the game 13/10

Solid gameplay and story

I thought the controls were clunky when I first played, but someone convinced me to give it another go, and I'm having great fun with the characters and combat.

I have this on both pc and ps5 and I have to say it's one of the best games I have played Larian make amazing games a long story not locked behind pay walls fun gameplay amazing NPCs (trust me I normally hate NPCs) I can't wait to see what Larian make next

Protect Larian Studios at all costs.

maybe the real baldur were the gates he made along the way

yeah uh. yeah this is good

I've never been hugged by game developers before until I booted the squirell into a tree

It's BG3 - you want to play this. Why do you need us to tell you. Why are you wasting your time reading reviews when you could be playing BG3....go. NOW!!!

best rpg

pretty freakin bitching

This game is awesome and very gun! I love playing it, and Ill play it anytime!

It took me forever to finish but there a few games that bring me to tears at such a great ending to a terrific game.  I remember buying this day 1 on early access and just watching the game grow and shape into the masterpiece it is today.  I went into this as a sorcerer on tactician mode and it was rough but I hope to do an honor mode run eventually.  My favorite party member in this game was everyone! Everyone was just so great and awesome and I don't know what else to say lol.  Anyways 10 out of 10. Larian studios you should be proud!

boobs butts baldurs gate

game fun af.

If you love D&D, Baldur's Gate 3 is everything you could want and more! The story is epic, with twists, turns, and so many ways to shape your adventure. Your choices really matter, and the characters are so well-written that you'll feel like they're part of your own party. (You can kill almost everyone at any time and it actually has a massive impact on the story!)

The replayability is insane! Every playthrough feels different. Whether you're trying out different classes, experimenting with wild decisions, or just seeing what happens when you pick all the chaotic options, there's always something new to explore.

Played this multiple times. With friends, with my wife, by myself. Great time all around.

you get to customize your genitalia 10/10

It's really well made.

10/10

Great gameplay, deep story. Could use a little more customization

It's one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

werewolf sex/10

i just started to play so far i like it

I like this game.

I love DnD, and this has got to be one of the best games I've played in a very long time! I'm not that far in but I know this is a modern masterpiece! Just like DnD, you really feel like you're there with your companions!

Not my cup of tea. I prefer less rigid games with more replayability

this game is incredible! i love almost everything about it.

you know what i don't love? seeing a game that was hyped up for "inclusivity" and "great customization" simply REFUSE to make plus sized characters. there are several different npcs that are fat, and all are enemies, portrayed as disgusting, unlovable, horrific monsters. there are plus sized ogres, and an enemy you fight who's entire thing is being a gross fat blob. as a plus sized person with an eating disorder, it really hurts to see the fact that they're capable and willing to make fat models, but only for the bad guys. 

the "big" body types just make them more muscular and a little taller. you literally CANNOT be fat. even gale (who says himself he doesn't really leave his house?) has 8 pack abs. 

literally everything else about this game is amazing, but seeing the monster in the bar in the shadow cursed lands made me so depressed i almost cried. is that how you see fat people, larian? are we that disgusting and unforgettable to you? 

add plus sized tavs please, im so tired of being twink-ified.

Great game

Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Just beat the campaign on Tactician difficulty after 170 hours of gameplay (although 10 or so hours of that were me being AFK) as a half-elf fire sorcerer. If you're a completionist like me and have to explore every possible area of every map and try to do every single side quest, this incredible game has at least 100 hours of gameplay, more like 150+. What really makes Baldur's Gate 3 such a masterpiece is the presentation - the story is fantastic, interesting and full of twists and turns. The characters are some of the best in any game ever made with excellent voice acting - you will be emotionally attached to many of these characters. The world is interesting - full of secrets, magic and mayhem. The presentation is easily a 10 out of 10. The gameplay is almost perfect as well - the combat systems are engaging, fun and require strategy to triumph in battle. Exploring is fun and there are many secrets to find. Leveling up your characters and finding/buying better and better gear is a joy. Your dialog choices make a real difference on what happens in the game which makes things more exciting. The only real complaints I have about the gameplay are first that the NPCs are painfully dumb. You can kill a nearby NPC in another room as long as you're out of sight, then their friend/associate NPC will walk into the room with the corpse and not even react most of the time. Also the NPCs will be standing in the same spots and having the same conversations over and over for basically the entire game. Sure this makes sense for vendors, but for a group of random people to be standing in the same spot multiple days in the row talking about the same stuff is a bit illusion breaking. While I understand it would have been an immense task to make the NPCs more natural with their behaviors, it would have made the game feel more realistic... maybe there's a mod that fixes that. Second, since the battles are turn based, if there are a good amount of enemies (10+) the battles can sometimes take a long time to finish. I fought some battles that lasted for an hour. In some ways it makes the battles feel more epic, and being turn based does mean more strategy is involved, but sometimes I found myself thinking "this battle would have taken 5 minutes instead of 1 hour if this game wasn't turn based." Still overall I enjoyed the turn based combat as I haven't played many turn based games in the past. Besides the dumb NPC behavior and sometimes exhausting length of the turn based battles and some other minor complaints that aren't even worth mentioning, the gameplay in Baldur's Gate 3 is still fantastic and I would rate the gameplay a 9.5 out of 10. With a 10 out of 10 for presentation, that makes my overall rating for Baldur's Gate 3 a 9.75 out of 10. An absolutely incredible experience in gaming that I will never forget. 

If you are an experienced/advanced/expert gamer, I would absolutely recommend playing Tactician difficulty, because even on Tactician I didn't find it all that challenging save for a few segments. Granted, I did a lot of reloading saved games when I started losing a battle or got a bad dice roll/outcome. On my next playthrough I definitely plan on playing Honour Mode which prevents cheesing with reloading saved games, makes bosses even harder and has perma death if your entire party dies. In my next playthrough I plan to choose the Fighter class and possibly try multiclassing. Might try the multiplayer, but most likely will let the game sit for a few months before returning because after 170 hours, I think one of the many other games in my Steam library deserve some attention. Anyways... buy and play Baldur's Gate 3... you'll be happy you did.

Buy it.

game of year

If you're a established fan of DnD, then you'll probably like this game. This was my first exposure to it and I had no idea what was going on in the story. Several story beats seem to rely on you knowing a lot about the DnD lore. Which I do not. So it all went over my head and mean nothing to me. Lost interest and never finished the game. I don't see myself ever coming back either.

An absolutely beautiful game, that brings you back time and time again. The story, the visuals, the sound, the voice acting, everything about this game, is so incredibly amazing. I've never played a game that made me this invested. This game will go down as one of my favorite games of all time. Bar none.

3rd person Skyrim with choices that actually matter 10/10

One of the greatest of all time

i mean its alright

Its a lot of fun

Great fun to explore, interesting (sometimes hilarious) side quests, a clear love for the games that came before, and you can tell the people who made it had a lot of fun. Always new things to discover after several playthroughs, even if you're just playing through one act over and over. Especially fun to play with a friend.

Incredibly disappointing. Did not meet the hype. The reviews feel like they are an overreaction to a woke storyline. This never felt like a Baldur's Gate game.

The mind flayer opening chapter was gross and not believable. When one of the infected people were "commanded" to transform into a mind flayer it felt like it was really gross and felt like it was written by someone who's into BDSM.

Character selection was ruined by a bunch of androgynous characters that all look the same. Only a trans activist could possibly be happy with character selection.

Don't waste your money.

It's an exceptional DnD story that's worth experiencing over and over!

shart

This game is Art.

This is one of the best games I've ever played. It ranks with The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Brothers 3, Final Fantasy 6/3, Final Fantasy 7, and Final Fantasy Tactics.

An overrated game. If compared to BG2, really pale. Little replayability since there will be no DLC expansion & all those community mod so far I did not see new adventures etc. Makes me wonder all those good reviews about how insanely good this game is are done by own people or people who like the developer more than the game. To me, it is an average RPG game because I played BG2 a lot & my expectation of this game is based on BG2.

Look at what everyone else said. It worth it.

very fun and in depth story, this is my first Baldur's Gate game (and sadly most likely my last last due to production for BG4 being cut short) as someone who has never played D and D I thought it was going to be a game I wouldn't enjoy but boy was I wrong. I sped run the main story on my first play through (40+) hours and there was so much to do even though I skipped a huge part of the side quest. This game offers endless replay ability and even more so with the included Mod Manager. 11/10 would 100% pay full price for this game again but if you can grab it on sale that would be even better!

bought loads of stuff from a trader, waited for him to turn around only to pick pocket my money back, walked off and he accused me of stealing his money, so i massacred the whole village 10/10 will pick pocket again

Stab

Crash's a lot, pain in the ass. Controls are not set up intuitively. Kind of mad I bought it now.

I have played BG and BG2 all the way through and this game is amazing. Graphics are awesome and the storyline is good. I am only near the end of Act 1 so I am looking forward to more of BG3!!

Best RPG Since the Mass Effect Trilogy. Just play it if you care about story, depth, writing, and choice-based gameplay.

Slow and cumbersome combat. The AI pathing is just as bad as the ancient icewind dale and BG2 games were. It feels like a storyline was plastered onto a copy/pasted game with slightly better graphics.
I have no idea how anyone could consider this a GOTY.

This game is pretty mid.

my favorite game of all time, give it a try!

amazing game, 10/10. if you like DnD or skyrim or similar games, you will love this game

THIS GAME IS A STRAIGHT UP GOD-SEND FOR DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS PLAYERS! The Character Customisation is a 10/10 , the Storyline is also a 10/10, The CHARACTERS ARE SO DOWNRIGHT AMAZING - especially the big 4 (Astarion, Gale, and Karlach, and Wyll - Absolutely despise Lae'zel...), BUT OVERALL 100/100! I love everything about this game, it's downright gorgeous. I would recommend this game to any nerd with a passion of adventure and suprises.

Counteracting Review bomb.

Great game. Genre defining. Please do play it if you enjoy this Genre

The game is engaging and well designed.

yes

10/10

Very Game

Laptop runs this at 15fps on min. graphics. 1000% worth it.

Great Game

Pros: Larian really went into depth with each possible action you could have taken in this game, and that to me is breathtaking, and a good wave of fresh air, compared to the release and ruin of our beloved Dragon Age Veilguard (God rest her soul), Starfield, and the Fable series that is supposedly making a comeback, but I haven't heard much on the new game for it, but we all know how much we loved the third one, just another example of big time producers not taking their fanbase seriously, or just putting plain lazy writing into their games.   Larian clearly has a knack for this kind of thing, and I feel they are the new Bioware, in terms of quality, and diversity in their games.  I'm almost tempted to get Divinity Original Sin, because I know I will love it just the same.   I'm yapping quite a bit, but let me get into Baldur's Gate specifically.   They matched the lore, skillsets, classes, spells, creatures, allies, races, in my opinion, as best as they possibly could, but correct me if I'm wrong.  The graphics are beautiful, the physics, the interactions, the dialogue choices and outcomes changing depending on your class and people interacting with you differently according to your race, most of the time.  There are a few who don't really get any special recognition in conversations, but most of them do, and I think that's amazing.  The diversity in how people act in your presence, reminds me of how Skyrim was with different races as well, and that really brought in great nostalgia for me.  From start to finish, it's an intense journey, not only doing quests and sidequests, but doing companion quests as well, and opening new routes to your relationship with that person depending on your choices, but if you don't have the patience to listen and be closer to them, you really don't have to, but then why have them in your party in the first place?  The characters are so great, and in great detail, have a variety of different personalities that draw you in, so you most likely have favorites along the way. Mine were always Shadowheart, Lae'zel, Karlach, and Gale, but Jaheira was also good.   I apologize if my explanations are kind of lack luster, I'm doing my best not to spoil anything.   That's the beauty of this game though, my particular experience i'm explaining, may not be the same as yours, but I'm a sucker for a goody two shoes playthrough, and so my experience is unique to me.

Cons: As many choices and possible outcomes you have control of along the way, the unfortunate part is that, there IS some illusion of choice. Like if you play durge, and Elfira comes to your camp, and you choose to send her off, she unfortunately ends up dying by you anyway, and if you don't meet with Elfira in the grove, it's usually some other Dragonborn girl, who is very sweet, and I don't think you have the choice to send her off, but regardless, she ends up dying in Elfira's place regardless. It kind of messes with my head, that the only way to send Elfira off is to be an absolute douchebag, but again, if you've met Elfira, she dies regardless, even if she leaves the camp.  Another one is the Underdark, when you free Nere, two other gnomes come out, but one of them gets killed in an instant cutscene usually 5 seconds after breaking the rubble.  I've even tried to attack Nere before the event is triggered, and she just disappears, and it frustrates me that it's forced.  Another sort of forced outcome is killing Cazador, and having the choice to either kill the kids and other prisoners with the staff out of mercy, set them free, and let them roam in the sewers and underdark, and one other choice I can't remember, but I think you can control them, but you can never cure them unfortunately, and that breaks my heart, but I try not to judge it too harshly because maybe that's just Canon and I don't know a damn thing about how D&D works, at least not as much as I'd like. I know it's a lot to ask, but to me, having choices means, any and all possible outcomes should be within our control, and unfortunately, as our actions DO have consequences, both good and bad, you're very limited to like 3 or 4 possible outcomes.   You might think that's good, but truly you have choice A, Choice B, Choice C, or Choice D.  and I think maybe we're just not in that realm that every possible choice can be...well..possible. I would think maybe an AI would have to be in place, and it probably wouldn't be advanced enough in this day and age to really fulfill that many different choices.   With that out of the way, my main thing is the companions, good god, they are thirsty, you haven't known them for even a night, and most of them want to throw themselves at you, right out of the get go, and to me, that's out of character, especially for Lae'zel.  I mean, maybe some of them should be available right away, I mean, some people are like that, but the fact all of them are there throwing themselves at you, but if you don't take them, then the choice for a relationship is suddenly cut off in the next 2 acts if you don't take your chances, and that seems a little unfair, cause maybe I want to get to know them a bit more before doing all of that, especially after doing a quest for them, that would seem a more valuable reason to fall for me, rather than just having fought with the enemy a couple of nights, and now they're all suddenly impressed and hot and bothered, ect.  I love all of the companions except Astarion, and many would argue there's no good reason to single him out, but I mean, from a moral standpoint, you realize he puts himself first in every possible situation, especially when it came to be that he was the reason those children were down in Cazador's prison in the first place.  Vampire or not, he was conscious enough to realize how sick and twisted that was, and in my book, that easily disqualifies him from being any bit likeable, especially when you want to save the grove and protect the kids, and he disapproves, like really? Because you had it hard, you would rather these kids lives be in danger and forfeit, because you never personally knew what safety and compassion felt like?  As I love the actor for him, the character is just a heinous little twat, and he's very full of himself, but he's hot, so we can push his past actions aside and really coddle him because he's upset about his own past. Being a vampire may not have been his choice, but whether or not to follow Cazador, was.   When it comes to the life of a child, the easy choice is, put the child first, let them have a life in exchange for your own, give them what you didn't have, that's the only real genuine choice in the matter, nothing else.  You went through it this way, so he apparently wishes the same on them? Please, if he was ugly, you wouldn't give him the same benefit.   Anyway, besides all of that, I have maybe one more thing that could be seen as a spoiler. Yes there is a happy ending, but unfortunately, I think what causes people to say "bittersweet" ending, is that, more or less for everyone to be happy, and have a happy life, either you, or one of your companions must be at its expense.  Anyway, this is all I have, I hope this helps you, and thank you for reading

I don't play games so much anymore. Bought this at basically everyone's recommendation. It feels a lot like playing D&D, especially when I did an optional dungeon crawl in Act I. So much effort and heart very obviously put into this game.

owlbear.

GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE GALE

Not my favorite game.

<3

Fundamentally this is a great game, it just isn't the game I was hoping for. Unfortunately I kept bouncing off it over my near 60 hrs of playtime due to a few things. I found the story and pacing not that great and by Act 3 I felt the momentum was gone and I was bored. The callbacks to previous games in the series didn't hit at all with me. In short, it doesn't have the soul of the Baldurs Gate originals and I could never get past that.

I can fix him.

Great game! Extremely flexible character building options, story and problem-solving options, and combat approaches. I'm sure there are bugs, but I haven't run into anything yet.

All around super fun game, with lots of options and freedom to do almost whatever you could imagine within the story.

Great game

honestly so much to do and so many hours that are capable of being put into this such an amazing story and tons of different endings and ways of playing

One of the best RPGs of all time

i have over one hundred hours and I have not even seen act 3

If you like dnd or if you're curious about it this game captures the soul of the game and presents it in a cinematic and easy to follow way. I would recommend for both veterans and beginners alike.

game good

Highly recommend 👍

Good Game. 

Fantastic Voice Actors, Amazing story telling, characters feel realistic and fun to chat with. This game may not be for everyone, but highly recommended.

muito bom

900+ hours in this game and I can't think of a single reason why you should play it... becasue there are a hundred.

SHADOWHEART

The game is great, awesome combat, good quests and amazing storytelling.

Yes

Only the best game ever

I hate this game so much 10/10

Good stuff

- First game to break my F5 (qucksave) key!
10/10

Made enough gold to build my own baldur's gate

Steep learning curve but wow, what a game. The attention to detail, the voice acting, the huge number of choices left to the player. Really cool game, hope other companies take note.

One of the best RPGs to come out in our era.

Totally lives up to the hype!

I JUST WANTED TO PLAY DND WHY ARE ALL THE MEN FLIRTING WITH ME HEEEEELP

great

Game. Good.
Game. Real Good.
Game. Really. Really, Good.

wow shadowheart's actally so nice when you don't leave her to die in the nautiloid

I love the continued support from the devs for this awesome game.


It's incredible.

i love my vampire twink house husband

ABSOLUTE CINEMA 🤷‍♂️

I bought this game for my girlfriend. She beat it and later broke up with me.

went in with high expectations and left severely dissapointed.

10/10 best dating sim idk if there is options i will only rizz the vampire

Game of the Decade.

The story design is a masterclass. All decisions you make feel important, immersive, and fun. Worth every penny.

it  good

very good!

Literally perfect... IDK what to say. You can do almost anything you want in this game.

good

fun

best game of all time

Ive always loved Larian games and this one is by far one of the better ones. Highly suggest playing it

It's an incredible game, obviously. The only thing that irks me is the difficulty of some of the puzzles or quests, which was an issue with Divinity as well. I would prefer the option to have some king of compass pointing to a quest, or a spell that create a pathway towards it. I ended up being told early on that if I leave the current area I can't return, at which point I'm forced to slug away at exploring the same old areas for ages until I lose the will to live.

9.8/10, the few immersion-breaking moments only stood out because of the high standards of creative freedom and emergent gameplay set by the other 98% of the game

Why is there fighting in my dating simulator

Vampire twink made me bust

Very Nice, makes me go yippee

good

i will romance the same woman every time

Easily best game of the decade

It's good.

Phenomenal game. As someone who had no exposure to turn based games, this was a great experience. Combat was lenient enough to brute force through it without using too much brain. Some fights did need some brain power to gain advantage or even out playing field against the ganks. The story was good. Lae'zel had the best character arc imo. She was also the best damage dealer in my party of Karlach, Lae'zel, Shadowheart and Gale (I played as Karlach for some reason). I missed out on some content in act 2 I think. But in subsequent runs, I plan to get that covered and also try some new things. The game has few annoying things imo. But nothing as annoying as the jump getting disrupted by smallest of obstacles and wasting my movement.

If you are willing to have an open mind about turn based combat, invest in lot of time in quality story and gameplay, this game is a must have. 9.5/10 for me (docked 0.5 points for some annoying bugs and glitches).

In short, I'm obsessed.

What a great game, and I hope to finish this game sometime in 2025 lol

i just dont like how involved the characters are. there are too many buttons and its too much like persona. if you like it good for you but thats not my thing, i wanted an arpg and i mostly got a talking simulator

the only mistake i made was not buying it earlier

it's good!

i came for the vampire and left with the vampire and several other lovers.

This game earned every last one of its many awards for a damn good reason.

hot tiefling lady (this was a Christmas present)

The endorphins when the crit hit text goes above the enemy. This game is like addiction and I love it.

Damn good game

Super overrated. I knew this was going to be like this since I heard Larian was going to make it, they make cartoons for CRPGS, and also it's an EA leftover. No voice acting for your Avatar either. Playing it and going to play just because it's Baldur's Gate, just because it's D&D.

nice

please describe what you liked or disliked about this product.

Baldur’s Gate 3 is nothing short of a masterpiece. Larian Studios has set a new standard for me, giving me an interesting story, immersive gameplay, and an incredible adaptation of one of my favorite franchises. As a long time Dungeons & Dragons fan, I'm constantly fangirling over lore and trivia within and getting to see more has always been exciting.

Gameplay-wise, the turn-based combat system is incredibly satisfying, blending the tactical depth of D&D 5e rules with the visual polish of a modern game. There might be some gaps, though I credit that just as easily to D&D's mechanical-crunch pitfalls rather than Larian.

Really enjoyed the multiplayer aspect as well, and I would absolutely kill to see more content provided in this style by Larian (or the modding community).

Only negative is that this will set the bar for future RPGs. That, and making a new character means pulling through Act 1 and 2 again. As someone who makes new characters often, I've only beaten the game once.

I needed a bit to get into the Game now i love it for all the right reasons

Baldur's Gate 3: Where rolling a 1 in a romance scene is more devastating than in combat.

People who like DnD games, this is THE game
Personally, one of the best games I have ever played

zalupa

great game

Very good game. Karlach is hot

i love this game sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. <3

Was compelled to write this review because the endless hype and praise around this game is a bit puzzling to me. I understand that if you didn't play the classic Baldur's Gate games or are semi new to RPG games in general this is a well made and entertaining game, no question about it. But for someone's who has played through every Divinity, Baldur’s Gate and a score of other RPG's, there is actually not much new stuff to see here. It's a re-skinned Divinity, with all the standard RPG features that are systematically and soullessly put into every RPG these days. Grind through a linear world, get some npc followers and grind through their quests, grind through some standard RPG content, dungeons, puzzles etc. in a world that feels like some kind of an entertainment theme park that you must wade through rather than an actual world that you’d be excited to explore. Nothing feels relevant or connected to a larger plot. The most memorable moments we’re memorable because they were funny, such as asking a random creep gouge out my eye. But even these kinds of moments were mostly immersion breaking comical scenes that made no one in the party including the player character react in anyway.

To this day, the old BG’s stand out from the masses of RPG’s with their amazing item and combat balancing, non-linear world and epic companions who made you laugh with their silly remarks rather than start instantly pestering you with their boring personal drama. In today’s RPG’s all your NPC’s are some drama bloated whiners whose conversation options you have to exhaust and who all want to get into bed with you as fast as possible just cause sex scenes must be entertaining to the player. They are well designed characters sure, but they all follow the same basic unsurprising formula. And in this game they’re all forcefully tossed into your party during the first 15 minutes of game-play, so there’s no sense that anytime some cool new weirdo might wanna ask to join your party.

There was actually a lot of interesting variety in the old BG’s NPC scene. For example you could recruit some random evil bastards who approach you cause you’re alone and need some temporary muscle. You have your sister with you who you probably wanna keep alive just cause she’s your sister. You could romance the hot elf in your party IF you get her boyfriend killed first. You have actual reasons to like or dislike your companions, which is completely missing from these modern RPG’s. For example when you finally got a wizard to join your party, you begged to go solve her personal problems just because she’s so freaking useful to your party. Oh and there’s an actual plot and a goal in the old BG’s, but what the heck am I doing in BG3 other than going forward with a maggot in my head (which you don’t even feel a need to get rid of because it gives you powers). And I sure don’t care about the gazillion useless magic items that keep cluttering my inventory as I force myself to rummage through every boring nook and cranny that all yield the same generic loot.

Also... You’ll be going through hundreds of boring slow paced roll animation skill checks in this game. You’ll be spending more time on removing traps from a puzzle than actually trying to solve a puzzle. Every skill check is pointless, can be fairly easily passed with a character that has no relevant skill level, and even if you fail, you can just load game from just before you made the roll. I have to keep forcing myself to come back to this game, which is not a sign of a very engaging game to me. And, oh boy, this review got long even though I didn’t even get to the turn based combat part.

I wish volo would lobotomize me so I could replay this masterpiece of a game again like I did for the first time.

big w

best game ever !!!!


this is the best game ive played in a long time, goes directly to my lifetime top

best game ever made

1

About  one year ago I was unsure if Baldur's Gate 3 was the type of game I would like to play. But I still tried it. After 1k hours I still want to play more. BG 3 might just be the best game ever made and playing it just makes me happy.

This game is great! you can push people of cliffs, if you find that sort of thing funny.

this game is a creative masterpiece, a dedication to DnD and the creators truly love both their game and their players

When the Trailer came out the OG one i was excited AF after all Larian has made some of my favorite games of all time. Dragon Commander, DOS 1 and of course DOS 2 so good! The Lore is confusing but still bloody fun. I purchased this game in ye olden days of Early access and i thought maybe 60 bucks is too much for EA but i trusted the Studio and i was not disappointed EVEN THOUGH so much jank in those early days i knew something magical was happening (pun intended) You had a lot of freedom and then after sinking many hours into ACT 1 mind you. I would put it down and then play it After every new update i always watch the streams. Sven and the Team have a great sense of humor THE SALAMI. Also Sven is a Discworld Fan so another point. Fast forward Game is released i started a new run as Tav a Half-Orc Sorcerer with a past of being poor and street smart. THE AMOUNT OF LOVE that went into this game is amazing and the level of choice you can do and Speak with the Dead. OWLBEAR AND DOGGO don't get me started on the writing its bloody fantastic the people you choose to travel with don't feel like video game peoples but Actual Characters with their own wants and motivations lots of love went into these performances and Astarion's Voice Actor winning the Game of the Year Award is well deserved. 
This notion that we shouldn't expect games from other major Devs of this love and quality is just where the AAA industry is currently at rn they care more about profit margins, a formula instead of trying something new. Svens speech was always  on spot on and like he said you make games that the Devs love to play people will buy it. Instead of chasing Trends stop being so safe. Also enough with Celebrities in Video Games its distracting (Except Johnny Silverhand and Idris Elba) they are awesome and ofc JK simmons. BUY THIS GAME

good game :D

If you are anything like me and want a game based on skill and fair results, steer clear. This is not for you. Proabably a good game otherwise (just look at the positive reviews), I just end up savescumming every choice and roll, and that, is anything but fun. Oof.

.

10 out of 10. i've enjoyed thing game as much as playing actual table top DnD.

10/10


Great game, though when I last played a year ago act 3 was vaguely incomplete. I'm sure by now everything is fine as every patch seems to add a great deal of polish.

de

Honestly ended up playing more of that dnd based minigame than the main game

It’s still a good dating sim tho

(SECOND) BEST GAME EVER CREATED !!!
(ELDEN RING NUMBER 1)

11/10

I`m addicted

good story, good art, good voice acting, good graphics (booba & schlong)
in conclusion, good game.

loved this game and going to replay it

Nice graphics, great storyline, fun to play.

i have over 1,000 hours in this game (started playing on Xbox then switched to PC) and i absolutely adore this game. there's a million different outcomes for everyone regardless of playing a good or evil run.

Definitely one of the best games I've ever played. I am really looking forward to anything new from Larian.

BG3 helped me cope with depression. Easily one of the best games ever made. I was a bit skeptical of the gameplay at first given I wasn't familiar with the genre, but I figured it out and I started enjoying the game even more.

freedom hawk tuah

To be successful, you have to do everything,  and the tasks are often non-transparent.  I get a little tired of that.  However, if you figure them out, and do them in a rational order, they can all be accomplished

Freedom to do what you want and play how you want, great story, amazing characters, and teaches anyone who doesn’t know how to play D&D how to grasp the ttrpg.

One of the most expansive games ever made. Even if you have never played a game like this you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.

Overall, it's good, but Act 2 is pretty underwhelming and TBH this would have been better if it was about 50% shorter. I'm just saying its okay if you see the accolades and thirty thousand positive reviews and bounce off it.

Very good

Got killed by a crab

How dare they...How dare they make a game with so many options and my goofy ass makes the same ones every time lol. For real though this is such a damn good game. From story telling to hidden gems to combat. We love a fully flushed...fleshed... thought out games. This remain in my top games of all time.

One of the best games I ever played

As there are plenty of reviews out there already singing the praises of this game independently, I'd figure I'd add the perspective of someone with many, many hours of [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] and especially [i]Baldur's Gate 2[/i] under my belt -- and I mean the original releases that came on multiple CDs, not the remasters. 

For an old fogey like me, the biggest thing to get used to is the combat. While BG and BG2 were turn-based with pause, BG3 is fully turn-based; where BG2 was based on D&D 2e and 3e, BG3 is based on 5e. Since I had no tabletop experience with it before this game, it also served as an introduction to 5e for me (or at least Larian's house-ruled version, as changes are inevitable when you're translating a game from pen and paper to computer). So a lot of this review is actually going to be about that, too.

I was skeptical when I heard that despite its length, the game topped out at 12th level (BG1's low level combat was extremely one-sided, and BG2 [i]starts[/i] at 8-10, depending on class) and that your party had no more than 4 people (down from 6), but as it turns out this is mostly compensated for by the deepened combat system. Mobility and positioning are far more important now, since movement is restricted each turn and enemies make far better use of theirs. Spell-like abilities are far more abundant, meaning pure spellcasters are not as impressive/overpowered as they used to be. Battles are now much more an exercise into correctly applying the limited use of every character's vast pool of options, rather than the classic "mage and fighter meat shields" setup of most BG2 battles. Both systems have their pros and cons, but the 5e system is a lot more balanced between classes if nothing else. Though, if you like your fights absolutely unbalanced and unfair, BG3 has plenty of options for that as well, mostly by abusing the physics system in ways I'm sure a tabletop DM would never allow.

Speaking of classes, that's been completely overhauled too, with the ability to pick a class on every level, rather than the mechanically more complicated and restricted multiclassing and dualclassing from 2e/3e. This is a fun and versatile system that allows you to mix and match proficiencies and abilities to build a character you like without being dependent on having a specific kit designed for them. One thing that holds back the fun somewhat is that the game's length means you will be at the lower levels for a [i]long[/i] time, so if you have a build planned that only really comes into its own at the later levels you'll be waiting on that quite a bit. You do get access to a cheap and easy way to respec your character early in the game, so switching builds depending on their viability at each stage is an option.

In terms of the actual combat in the game, the biggest hurdle is understanding the system and the action economy (there are "actions" and "bonus actions" and they are mostly not interchangeable), but once you do most fights pose little problem. There are only a handful of fights I would call challenging, and even on the highest difficulty levels you will find yourself with an inventory full of weapons, items and consumables that you don't need to win. The main thing making the game's hardest difficulty setting "honour mode" a true challenge is that you have to do it all on a single save, which enforces extreme caution. I personally prefer just having tougher but replayable battles over an ironman mode, but fortunately the game is very moddable, so there's options if you want the game harder, or trivialize combat entirely so you can focus on the story.

Combat mechanics aside, the role-playing part is where it gets really fun. Whereas the standard approach in most RPGs is fighting, or getting a quest item, or getting a quest item by fighting, BG3 leans a lot more into your character's background and proficiencies, and relies on abundant dice rolls for everything. Skipping things or doing them out of order is practically the norm, and the game is built to handle it. When it's firing on all cylinders, the game feels like an actual tabletop session of D&D, where your party pulls outrageous stunts (and/or spectacular failures) based on how the dice favored their crazy ideas, while the DM wearily looks on and rewrites campaign notes in the background. There is still plenty of combat and a few major places where fighting your way out is unavoidable, but these stand out when contrasted with how often you can talk or physically manipulate your way out of things. As with any CRPG there are still always places where you wished you had more options, but the game does a good job of accommodating you.

So is the game perfect then? Well, no, nothing is. It's very, very good, but there are blemishes. Small physics, camera and UI glitches that are fortunately mostly resolved by saving and loading the game. A classic if by now a bit antiquated approach to loot where the game showers you with magical items, but most of them are not very interesting or impressive and get chucked on the pile. Some mechanics, while adding flavor, feel tacked-on and inconsequential -- camp supplies, alchemy, dyes. There are cameos from companions in earlier games, but the story doesn't gel very well with how things were left at the end of the Bhaalspawn saga. There are weaknesses around the storyline if you want to play an "evil" character, with "good" characters definitely getting to see and do more. And while the game's immense size is surely hard to fault in terms of value for money, it does mean that by Act Three, when your course is pretty well set and it seems like things are ramping up to a confrontation, the game still throws new side quests at you like you're just starting out, which can lead to fatigue if you're not able to simply plow ahead and ignore them. 

So with all that, do I recommend BG3? ...are you kidding? If the many other reviews didn't already give you an indication, BG3 is an RPG with phenomenal and probably unparalleled scope, size, depth and quality, and more importantly, the ability to pull you in and keep you hooked. I've spent many a day going to bed far later than I should have just because there was "one more quest" to finish up, "one more area" to explore, and before I knew it I was neck deep into new shenanigans. It brought me all the way back to a time where BG2 was, for a long time, the only game I played, to the point where I learned all the ins and outs of the engine and even made a few mods for it myself. I'm (probably!) not going to go that far for BG3, but it definitely gave me the same feeling of wanting to go for another playthrough almost immediately after I'd finished the first one, even knowing how many hours that was going to take, just to do things differently this time. That time commitment is definitely not for everyone, as shown by the fact that no less than [i]half[/i] of all players don't even make it through Act One, but this game is so large that even just Act One would qualify as a full price release on its own for most studios. Not so Larian, and while they've broken many hearts by saying there won't be an expansion or sequel to BG3, by the end of this game you definitely feel the weight of all that effort and time the developers sank into it, and you can't really blame them for going "enough".

[i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is a game I think everyone should play, even if you don't complete it. Those who like CRPGs will almost certainly love it, those who have never played CRPGs may come to like the genre, and all in all this game is probably the best advertisement for [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] outside of the source material. It's a ray of sunshine in a gaming industry where insidious mediocrity and shameful cash grabs have become the norm for AAA releases, and we should thank our lucky stars for the fact that it's very replayable, because unfortunately we're not likely to see its match any time soon.

Basically a game with branching choices. So much fun, includes multiplayer...I just wish I had friends!

If you can imagine the option, usually it is.

The best game I have played in recent memory. I want to play more playthroughs.

As someone who typically doesn't enjoy CRPGs, Baldur's Gate 3 impressed me with its deep storytelling, rich character development, and engaging tactical combat. The game features stunning visuals, a vast world to explore, and offers immense freedom through meaningful choices and varied outcomes. It's a must-play for RPG fans, even for those who aren't usually drawn to the genre.

Baldur's Gate 3 is both fantastic and also disappointing. The good parts make the game worth playing, while the bad parts tend to help me to not get too involved in the game.

The graphics are decent, but I do find it funny to see and hear the NPCs talking out of sync with the animations of the mouth, facial expressions, and their gestures. 

The game camera can be annoying at times, but that is something that plagues all games of this style, especially in tight spaces.

The details of the environment and music is where the game excels. This vastly improves the story and gaming experience.

The stories are the most important part of this game for me. For this reason, I found myself questioning if I would be interested in finishing this game on multiple occasions. I took a long break at one point, for several months, because of how invasive the "adult" content was. Every character was pressuring the player to engage with them intimately. Some would even respond with a guilt trip type response when rejected. Gale was thankfully toned down, but seems Haslin is still just as persistent, in which I had to reject him no less than four times before he responded with a statement that he had to at least try. I even told him that I was involved with Shadowheart, he asked for a three-way. I find this very poor writing and awareness by the writers and takes away from the story and engagement of the lore and game. 

Excluding the overly forced and non-enjoyable attempts to turn the game into a brothel experience, the story is very intriguing. I like the concept and the game pacing seems to keep the game from feeling like a drag. I always had some quest that was actually compelling, if even not rewarding, due to it adding to the lore and explanation of the situation. 

Act I is a bit forced at the start, feeling rushed to get the player engaged, but gets better as it goes. 

Act II is the best part of the game and the most enjoyable. Each area has so much to explore and unique scenes that stuck with me. I found myself replaying Act II a few times to try different things, as the choices had some wildly different outcomes. This is the most pivotal part of the game, from what I saw.

Act III is a little hit and miss. This was also where Haslin kept asking me for more than friendship and eventually a three-way with Shadowheart. I did find that relationships have no impact on one another, as I could get the achievements with hooking up with Karlach and Squiddy, and it did not have any negative outcome with essentially cheating on Shadowheart. Comically, Shadowheart was not so interested in the twins at the brothel, which I was good with, as I had no interest either. Whoever wrote this stuff needs to touch grass and get a real relationship. 

The best part of Act III was the introduction to the atmosphere. Past that, it felt systematic and detracted from anything being unique, minus the Bhaal side of things which was very well done. 

The best part of the game is the music and atmosphere, which saved the story on many occasions, when it seemed it was more interested in letting me know what kind of intimate behavior an NPC preferred, over anything of substance for the story. I know the cleric likes the winged woman, and that the winged woman is the dominating partner of that relationship. I know it many times. I know Karlach wants to get freaky, I know it many times. I know Wyll has daddy issues and is repressed intimately, and I know it many times. I know that Gale will sleep with anything that moves, though that was toned down from when I first had to deal with it, thankfully. I know Haslin has problems and should be in therapy instead of trying to outdo the original Gale but with far more desperation. I think it was only Shadowheart, Lae'Zel, and Astarion who did not have constant needs to express some sort of need for stripping down and getting intimate. As such, they were usually my go to for a group. 

That said, I recommend the game, but know that there are some constant distractions to the story, where the writers and developers thought it more important to simulate a hard pressed dating game along with the adventure.

When an artist, creates art just because of being able to do so this game is what happens when the art is done. Larian Studios is not a greedy profit hungry company, this studio knows what and why they are doing.
I bought the game when it is released and after completing my first playthrough I bought the Digital Deluxe DLC, I wanted to support them furthermore and I hope in the future that is not so far away, they will brought us another gem.
BG3 is a perfect example of what other game companies should focus on.

One of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing since the beginning of the 2010s.

The story is amazing, the environments are captivating, the music only adds to the charm and immersion... The characters are great even if I think some of them could be better (looking at you Wyll, kinda thing we should have the chance to see the original). 

Swen said what we all have been saying for years! He was the only person within the industry to have the balls to say it publicly during a big event. Bring back the passion, the love, the magic. Profits will come if the players feel that their money is worth.

And please... LET MY DRUID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH BOO! :D

It turns out that not only will I be the first one who will know which game wins tonight, I'll actually also know which game is going to win next year, and the year after. Now how do I know this?

Well, an oracle told me. She said 'change is coming.'

It's a modern oracle, so she made me sign an NDA. But I trust all of you. I know you can keep a secret. You will never leak it.

The oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio who found the formula to make it up here. It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost.

The studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves.

The didn't make it to increase market shares. They didn't make it to serve a brand. They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if the didn't meet those targets.

Furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue, and don't serve the game design. They didn't treat their developers like numbers of a spreadsheet.

[loud cheering from the audience on that one, lol]

They didn't treat their players as users to exploit, and they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics. They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism, and wanted players to have fun. They realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun.

And they understood the value of respect. That, if they treated their developers and players well, those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned.

But above all they cared about their game, because the love games.

'It's really that simple,' said the oracle.

so addicting that i, too busy playing it, barely ate or drank water for four days then almost threw up and fainted. beware and play at your own discretion.

As someone who has not traditionally played this genre of game before, I was a bit hesitant to buy it. But after playing it for many hours, I would recommend everyone to play this masterpiece. I like games with a Narrative and many choices, I can say that no other game I have played offers this like BG3. The customisation of classes, the ability to be a paragon or a complete evil villain is awesome.

I plan to replay this game many times, just for the unique story each play through can offer. I don't usually replay games, even if I really enjoy them. This is one that I will definitely make an exception for.


I’ve never written a review for a game before, and I probably wouldn’t have this time either, but Sven’s speech at The Game Awards changed my mind. This game truly deserves it. I won’t talk about the graphics or any technical details. I’ll just say this: they gave me, someone who had never played a CRPG or turn-based game before, an incredible experience that lasted over 500 hours. It’s been almost a year since I first played it, yet it’s still on my mind, and I haven’t closed that chapter. I just wanted to thank Larian for this incredible journey.

The best DnD based cRPG ever made and potentially the best strategic cRPG ever made. Larian improves their formula on every new title and I am here for it.

This game spent so many years in development and is continuing to receive updates, and unlike other titles that take years for full release, Larian Studio's hard work SHOWS. The RPG aspects of this game stands so far above others that it could strip them of the title. While many will follow the same trodden paths, Baldur's Gate 3 truly rewards the 0.1% of players who think far outside the box and attempt crazy shenanigans.

Truly one of the greatest games I've ever played, and is anyone surprised? This isn't the first time (and it certainly won't be the last) Larian have put out a masterpiece. It's a shame that WOTC is such an unpleasant company to do business with, because the geniuses at Larian Studios have truly brought Faerûn to life in the most exciting and interesting ways possible.

The stories BG3 tells throughout its ~100h runtime (for a singular play-through) are excellent and are all worth experiencing, and from its companions to its villains, it's almost comical how easy it is to sympathise and relate to their tales. Their take on the combat system this time around was great, and still manages to feel unique even if you're coming from one of Larian's other games, such as Divinity: Original Sin 2. Speaking of DOS2, I also love the many ways you can approach combat encounters, whether it's talking your way out of it, setting up oil barrels and starting combat with an explosive kick, sneaking all of your party into advantageous positions to surprise the enemy, or just charging head-first into the fight.

Another improvement Baldur's Gate 3 has over Larian's previous titles is definitely the class system. While I loved DOS2 and the combinations you could pull off (Pyro/Geomancy, Hydro/Aerotheurgy, etc), I found that a lot of the classes were very similar in how they played and the skills they had access to. Here, each of the 12 classes offer different playstyles and absolutely have their own strengths and weaknesses. And yes, while some classes are definitely stronger than others (looking at you Paladin!), you can easily beat the game with any of the 12 and still enjoy it all the same. Multi-classing is also a tool that allows you to get even more complex with your character-building, but do not feel as if you need to utilise it to beat the game. It's definitely something you'll enjoy experimenting with once you've beaten the game once or twice.

In conclusion, PLEASE buy Baldur's Gate 3. It is easily one of the greatest CRPGs of all time and I am incredibly excited to see Larian's next works (Divinity 3 hopefully?). Nearly 400 hours sunk into the game at the time of this review and I plan on spending many, many more hours in the land of Faerûn.

Larian never tires of showing us what video games are all about. A demonstration that needs a lot of courage and class consciousness to show the entire community and such a predatory industry that games are not supposed to be about numbers, profit, CEOs or achieving financial goals, but about human beings, real people and real feelings (no wonder why indie games are so good).
Congratulations to everyone involved in such a grand ideal, and as always, f*ck capitalism and it's bourgeois pigs.

补个好评，在BG3里度过的这段时间非常快乐，会常回来看看！
至于谁在坚持以热爱驱动创作，用心做游戏不断提升玩家体验，大家有目共睹无需多言:)

It is a fantastic game. I have started several runs already and I never get tired of it. There are so many different ways to play, and the developers did not leave anything to chance. Top game.

This game has genuinely changed my life, much for the better. (And some for the worse— curse you Larian for making me stay up til 3 on a school night to play this game!)

All jokes aside, it's much better to go into this game blind. I went in with medium expectations. After all, I had played many RPGs before, and thought this one would be in a similar vein to ones I've already experienced: The Elder Scrolls (III-V); The Witcher 3; the latest additions to the assassin's creed franchise, and so on.

My. How wrong I was!

First off, the character creation: Good ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lord, you can make an entire gaming session out to be a character creation session. If you like 5e's selection of classes and races, you'll enjoy making a character in this game. One downside, is there are no appearance sliders, they're mostly presets. Which is fine, seeing as the game more than makes up for this in other aspects.

However, it more than delivers— it upstages the competition— when it comes to the *story*.

Each companion is fully voiced, mocapped, and have several possible developments to their character arcs based on each minutiae choice you make, with their approval tied to the actions you take. The game feels dynamic, like your choices actually matter— because they *do*. Not to mention, every character feels alive, thanks to the incredible performances their voice actors and mocappers put into them.

The story is spectacular, the graphics are beautiful; the animations fluid, and your decisions matter. It feels as though Larian truly knows what makes D&D special. A heartfelt thank you to all who spent countless hours putting work into this masterpiece of the RPG genre.

This is one of the greatest rpgs of all time.  I wasn't originally going to write a specific review until fools decided to review bomb the game due to a miss translated, ill conceived outrage, but here we are.

To completely cover the topic please see the many youtube videos about the subject bg3 review bomb and draw your own conclusions.

It's a great game with fantastic characters.  Crafted by the best artisans in the industry.  Lead by currently the most in-touch studio poised to create such art.  The folks behind this particular work deserve even more praise than the monumental, earth shaking amount they have already.

May this game, and larion studios, continue to be a bright light in the ever darkening future we currently see gaming trending toward.  May you all continue to find success.

Larian <3 Sven <3 The team <3 Best thing gaming industry could have in these dark times. Great timing for the game to exist and will be a game to play for the next decade, if not decades.

Game itself is also great, honors the genre with actual choices that matter and a lot of freedom to play the game in many ways, having interesting party members and engaging combat. (I have grinded the old BG series, IWD, NWN etc.). A lot of replay value, with actual different endings and events along the way. Totally worth the money even with full price. I have yet to continue my second play through (yes, I spend many hours on first play through investigating everything and everywhere, some hours are also from beta/alpha). A lot of content updates have come meanwhile so should be quite the new experience even if I played exactly as before. 

I can recommend this to anyone who can appreciate good writing, characters, a story, Larian. Do not let the DnD scare you off, you will learn along the way and ofc can set difficulty also to easier to enjoy a stroll in the fantasy park.

Genuinely one of the greatest RPGs ever made, sporting an incredible narrative, masterfully written characters, and engaging yet challenging gameplay. Well worth the price, just be prepared to sink in hundreds of hours into the game. 40/10 IGN

a masterpiece of a game with so many ways to play with so many endings. and such perfect voice acting. thanks devs for this terrific game and continued support

If you have ever pirated a game before because of it's rave reviews, please support the studios who deserve it, like Larian, with a purchase.

[spoiler] I totally did try the game via other sources, but loved it so much, I decided to buy it with the optional DLCs. [/spoiler]

Is it the best game in existence? Not sure.
Is it going to complete your life? Probably not.

What it is, is a game that is extremely well crafted, albeit with a few minor bugs here and there. The continued support for the game is also another reason why I decided to purchase the game despite [spoiler] trying it by other means [/spoiler]

10/10

This is one of the best RPGs ever made.  Buy it now.

It is like NWN and Dragon Age (the original) had a baby.  That baby then somehow Merged with Dungeon and Dragons and then was produced by the makers of Divinity: Original Sin.

Translation:
The scope and freedom of character customization and powers is on the NWN scale, the characters are incredibly packed with personality and have excellent dialog, and the game uses the Dungeon and Dragons system.  The final part is just the level of quality and dedication to the world that went into this game.  In other words, Larian Studios.


It's been a minute since I've played, but when we did play as a group of 6 in a campaign with the "party limit begone" mod we all had a lot of fun. I don't drop reviews often, but if i can counter one negative review from the BMW community that's salty they didn't win the GOTY award and are mad at Larian Studios just because they said truths about most video game developers. This game is a gem and a blast to be had with a group of friends, We still haven't even gone to the mountain pass route on any of our 3 playthroughs.

Love the game - so much to find on the next play through which I missed on the first go. Great story telling. Well done Larian - wish more games were as well made.

As someone thats spent over a year in real time playing rpg's I would recommend this to anyone thats looking for a fun adventure to play with friends or to play solo. Lot of depth from character customization to even the different quests available in the game. There are a few bugs that still exist in the game, but its nothing too game breaking. 

must play game for any rpg fan

[h1][b]I don't think there's anything I can write that 900 hours and counting doesn't say for itself.[/b][/h1]

I'd never played a strategy/adventure game like this before. My partner bought it shortly after launch, and I went in basically blind. Oh boy, was I in for it.

I'm obsessed and I'm going to tell you exactly what I think.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
[b]Playtime: ~100 hours.[/b]
Some do it in 80, others do it in 200. It depends on how much time you want to spend exploring and talking to NPCs; the maps are extensive and chock full of goodies. The layout of the maps does a good job of guiding you towards the vital stuff – quests, enemies, treasure – and it’s entirely optional to explore nooks and crannies. I’ll just say that [b]a few locations will give you a warning to “tie up any loose ends” – heed the warning before charging ahead.[/b]

The 4 difficulties (Explorer, Balanced, Tactician, and Honour Mode) are great for players of all kinds. I’m not gloating when I say this – I dipped into Explorer Mode for a Dark Urge run to just zip through as quick as possible, and it really didn’t feel like anything was missing. The game is so rich in almost every aspect that despite the lack of challenge in combat ([i]for me[/i]), I was enthralled. (I got into more fights just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, the game wouldn’t let me singlehandedly dismantle Baldur’s Gate’s police force no matter how hard I tried.) The step up from each difficulty is a pleasant punch to the face, too.

I [i]love[/i] the turn-based combat mechanics. Instead of relying on reflexes and muscle memory, you are required to be economical and strategic. Your turn can be 10 seconds or 10 hours – which also means I never feel like the game is holding me hostage from answering the phone or jumping up when I hear a cat chewing on plastic. Even with the slower pace, fights are anything but boring; when I’m running out of spells, running out of healing potions, and running out of health, I catch myself holding my breath during the enemies’ turns.

I’ve already been playing D&D for years, so I can’t speak to the learning curve of having no knowledge of D&D. [i](If you are one of those people, browsing class overviews on Wikidot or DnDBeyond can help.)[/i] However, the game did help me understand classes I wasn’t familiar with; I have used BG3 to test drive character builds. Seeing the characters in action gives me a clearer impression of their utility than the sourcebooks do. The implementation of the TTRPG into a single-player video game has been done [i]so well[/i]. There are variations and limitations, of course, but I am still shocked by how much creativity is not only allowed but encouraged. As of writing this, Larian is developing Patch 8, which will implement 12 additional subclasses on top of the 46 existing ones.

[i]Graphics are beautiful[/i]. Admittedly, I’m playing on a fairly new, high-powered PC so I’m having the best experience. There are some animation pops, clipping, and odd camera angles, but they are negligible. Larian continually smooths these out with updates.

[h2]Writing[/h2]

[h1]Plot[/h1]
The story is [i]rich[/i]. I’ll be honest, in my first game I was kind of just along for the ride – which is kind of on the nose for the hero of the story. For someone as unobservant as I am, the main story beats are easy to follow; these are the good guys, these are the bad guys. There are some grey areas, and the course of action is up to the player’s judgement. In those cases, the game seems to be pretty forgiving. I encourage folks to avoid spoilers; the consequences of your actions are evocative. In one game I was giggling and kicking my feet – in another, I actively hated myself for what I’d done. Okay, I’m being dramatic about the latter, but I did feel like Larian was holding up a mirror asking, “You wanted evil, right? Is this evil enough? Aren’t you having [i]fun?[/i]"

And there are [b]So Many Choices[/b]. So many paths you can take. Most of them are tiny detours that only give you a unique dialogue line, of course, but some of them will take you in wildly different directions. Your class, your race, your deity (if applicable) – all open up avenues to explore.

[b][i]I’ve written so much and I’m just talking about playing as your own custom character, there’s even more content if you choose to play as one of the pre-existing characters-[/i][/b]

[h1]Companions[/h1]
I have adopted them into a polycule in my mind. Jk but not really
First impressions don’t last; I immediately liked half of them, disliked a couple, and was ambivalent about the rest. Act 1 was rough the first time around – the group felt discordant and all of them were trying to pull my attention in one direction or another. Which is…exactly how it’s supposed to be. You’re 6 strangers vying for your survival in different ways and, like, everyone thinks they know best and no one wants to die. They have very distinct personalities; it is interesting to see there are folks that vehemently detest my fave.

And then, with the slightest bit of diplomacy, everyone learns to cooperate. I’ve never actually made a companion hate me enough to leave (via disapproval – Durge choices need not apply here). The companions’ mannerisms and attitudes do change throughout the course of the game – and it can vary from one player to the next, depending on the myriad choices you’re presented with. Which is why I have 900 hours under my belt. I am delighted by the intricacies of the characters and I want to see them [i]all[/i].

The romances are fun! Each of the companions – save for Jaheira and Minsc – can be smooched if you win them over. Each romance has its own flavour and vibe. I’ve only seen Gale, Halsin, and Karlach’s romanced endings – they’re beautiful and heartbreaking and inspiring. Still, not even every romance ends the same way. I know of 4 Gale endings alone – [i]so far[/i].

I can’t talk about the companions without mentioning that Wyll was definitely hung out to dry. Although you, the player, have ultimate control over the party’s direction, each companion still has a degree of autonomy over their individual arcs that you can influence. Wyll, though, feels like a backseat passenger to his own life – and his arc is most closely tied to the overarching plot. He doesn’t have enough content, and I’m not hopeful that will change with future patches.

[h2]Atmosphere[/h2]
Sound design is immaculate. I play with headphones and the ambient environmental sounds are immersive in each area, whether you’re in the titular city or a ruined temple. The soundtrack is stellar and I put it on just to vibe to. I do turn the music down to 40%, though, because it can compete with character dialogue on occasion. 

[h2]Community[/h2]
At large, I believe the community is wonderful. I see many folks lending a helpful hand to one another over social media, sharing their characters and weaving their own stories. Every community has its bad apples, and with how many folks from around the world are in this online sphere, we have our fair share. The positive vibes far outweigh the negative ones.

[h2]Support[/h2]
Larian has its finger on the pulse when it comes to the BG3 community; it’s obvious they care about the playerbase and strive to give us a good experience. They frequently release fixes and communicate their plans to offer support. I’ve had to reach out to their team twice and received responses in a timely manner. This isn’t to suggest they are perfect and infallible, but it is the first experience I’ve had where I feel like I have a collaborative rapport with a developer – which goes a long way in my books.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I have so many more wonderful things to say but I've tired myself out.

I don’t even know where to start – Baldur’s Gate 3 has completely taken over my life (in the best way possible). I’ve finished it THREE times already, and honestly? I’m ready to dive back in. Every playthrough feels like a new adventure, and I love that I can make different choices and still feel like I’m playing a completely fresh game.

The graphics? Stunning. Like, STUNNING. Every little detail is just so beautiful – from the characters to the environments – it feels like stepping straight into a fantasy world. And the gameplay is so smooth, it feels effortless even during combat or dialogue-heavy parts. Honestly, I was hooked from the moment I started.

As someone who plays D&D live, this game gives me that same rush, but even when my friends are busy, I can just jump in solo and lose hours creating characters and living my best adventurer life. It’s like having my favorite D&D campaign available 24/7. And with all the different classes, races, and choices, there’s something for EVERYONE. Whether you want to be a spell-slinging sorceress or a sneaky rogue, Baldur’s Gate 3 totally has you covered.

If you’re even thinking about getting this game – just do it. You won’t regret it. And if you see me romancing certain characters for the fourth time… no, you didn’t.

Spent over an hour creating a character.  Died at first boss fight.  Highly recommended!

i mean what is there to say other than this game is a work of art and everyone should experience it at least once. personally, after having just beat it for the first time, already want to play again. SLAYYYYYYY

overall amazing game, no bullshit micro transactions or any other cash grabs. awesome replay worth and story. Can't recommend this enough.

Я не очікував що коли небуть пограю в щось на цьому рівні, мій ідеал cRPG був минулий проєкт Larian - Original sin 2.

Ця гра у всьому краще за дівініті, більшість речей що є в original sin 2 в тому, чи іншому, вигляді є в BG3, але складніше та цікавіше.

Світ і в минулих проєктів відчувався живим, але тут авторам вдалося стати ще на крок ближче в сторону занурення. Ваші компаньйони постійно обговорюють різноманітні речі, що вони думають про місцевість,  обмінюються досвідами з життя, погрожують один одному  навіть разом реагують на дії гравця, які вони знаходять схвальними або навпаки ганебними.
Тут, на відміну від попередньої гри, є можливість не вбивати, а лише оглушати ворогів, і запевняю, що це матиме наслідки, іноді більші ніж очікується...
Ваш персонаж, залежно від його характеристик та стартових навичок, зможе проходити перевірки атрибутів, які надають додаткову можливість чи інформацію про подію в яку гравець залучений або зможе стати залученим.

Пропрацювання кожного персонажа робить пере проходження більш цінними, надає глибину думок, які не були виказані персонажами будучі компаньйонами. 
Якщо для когось це буде новиною, Baldur`s Gate 3 є частиною світу DnD, тому має багатий лор який створювався десятиліттями навіть і без Ларіанів, гарно імплементований у саму гру, вас не примушують його вивчати, але дають змогу через книжки, листівки,  іноді ваші соратники будуть розповідати щось про свій народ, а іноді вам надасть ці знання одна з характеристик вашого персонажа як, наприклад "теологія" що дасть можливість краще зрозуміти Пантеон богів і їхні індивідуальні проблематики (майже завжди це відкриває варіанти в діалогах) і таких уміння багато.

Гра велика, в ній купа секретів, які не є просто шмоткою яку забрав і забув, ні, повноцінні таємні взаємодії, можливість розблокувати нових компаньйонів чи позбутися  не зовсім любих серцю.Перший акт зайняв в мене може 20-25 годин і ні на години не викликав в мене смуток, я грав за друїда і розмовляв з тваринами, ті хто грав в дівініті, знають наскільки шикарні діалоги можна мати зі звичайним псом, білкою, а у випадку з балдуром то ще і цілим гібридом сови та ведмедя, більш еталонних діалогів складно знайти).

Гра, як і її попередниця, не примушує гравця діяти, він піти куди завгодно, може проігнорувати конфлікти, чи стати на сторону винуватця, а потім його зрадити й стати головним поганцем.Нема лише одного шляху на проходження, знову ж є варіативність (яка не обмежується бути білим чи чорним).

Механіки Бою та його прогресії. У вас є шкала кроків які ви можете здійснити  одну дію та одну дод. дія. деякі класи можуть мати кілька дій чи дод. дій  що іноді дійсно є перевагою, авжеж до цього треба звикнути і тим хто грав в схожі ігри, і ти хто не грав взагалі в цей жанр.

Важливим аспектом бою є положення, адже тут воно ґрунтовно може поміняти становище сутичка,  вас може бути видно добре, може не дуже добре. може взагалі не видно, ви можете стояти на слизькій поверхні від чого навіть коли ви уражаєте не рухаючись ви можете впасти, а якщо ви впадете з висоти (в разі якщо вас відкинули) то ви можете і померти, чи ще гірше впасти на іншого персонажа й обом померти!!!, крутість цієї механіки в тому, що вона симетрична, як ви можете впасти та померти, так і ворог(и) :) деякі гравці навіть спеціально вибудовують свою групу так щоб наносити урон гравітацією, а не спелами чи зброєю.
у кожного персонажа, тварини, предмета є вага, яка умовно набирає швидкість падіння (візуальний ефект мінімальний) тобто якщо ваш персонаж жбурне спис з висоти 2 метрів, він нанесе менше урону ніж з висоти 3-х метрів, і як я казав раніше, ви та вороги отримуєте урон від гравітації.

На мою думку, це найкраща сюжетна 3д пісочниця), мав вдосталь експериментів з нею, щоб без заперечень сказати що з десь з 3 левела я шукав можливості повернутися в покроковий режим (бою, авжеж).  

(Прогресія з левелами збільшує кількість хп і розблоковує комірки для спелів того чи іншого рівня (ваш та менший), і більшість початкових спелів на урон можна прокастити використавши комірки різних левелів що тим чи іншим чином зробить його достатньо ефективним (збільшивши характеристики урону чи точності) до кінця гри.)

Цікаво те що гра забирає у гравця тривогу що до вибору між характеристиками, вони виставлені на самому початку і можуть бути пасивно покращені лише 2-3 рази (якщо забути про квести), і це кльово, адже в грі вистачає механік про які не варто забувати, тому кожен левел не займає довгі хвилини, дискусії що до вибору між спритністю та пам'яттю або ж рівням знання дерева окремої навички, щоб створити мультиклас.

До речі про мультикласовість, вона не складна, для ефективності не дуже варіативна, але достатньо комфортна. Кожен клас базується на одній з характеристик (мудрість, спритність, сила і тд.) і авжеж не кожен клас індивідуально залежний від певного параметра, таким чином у моєму проходженні в мене був барлок, та монах-пройдисвіт, клірик-паладін, варвар-паладін, не всі вдалі, але це не було проблемою, адже майже з самого початку гравцю дають змогу змінити класс і перебудувати себе чи компаньйонів.

Різниця в левелі, не супер помітна (1-3 левела, далі не дурний) коли б'єшся з ворогами вище рівнем, бо вони можуть так само 
використати спели рівня нижче чи взагалі мати особливі спели які не можливо отримати, не заперечую що це через те що проходив на балансі(це складність).

Гра неймовірно гарна, (серед ігор що виходили у 2023 році мені візуально найбільше апелює) так, досі можна знайти кумедні баги, аля тінь десь щось не домалюється, але більшість пофікшені, а ті що залишились надто складні для отримання

Я не грав у кооперативі, але з досвіду попередньої гри, припущу що так само якщо не більш цікаво, бо що може бути краще, а ніж страждати викидуючи віртуальні кубики з друзями) 



Рекомендую цю гру, і всесвіт DnD, не пожалкуєте.

Unfortunately this comment is not just about ther game.
1- BEST RPG! until another one releases in future.
2- Negative Chinese *******s must understand:
            a) Tga always contained money driven choices. You started playing single player games yesterday, thanks to wukong, so you might not know tga's furious choices.
            b) Astrobot is not a bad game, but you need specific hardware to fully experience it. This also happened in 2020, Half-Life Alyx didn't even nominated in best game category, since it needs specific hardware. But your protest is not about this. So shush!
            c) They let Swen talk this long because they didn't last year. They even brought grumpy muppets to release some anger about how "sellout" the show is. 
            d) The speech Swen made is about the industry, it's not about your knock off souls game. 

For the sensible Chinese players: The game is amazing. Don't read these ultra nationalist, multiplayer only negative commenters. I played this, this is great. Didn't played wukong, but it looks good. But i probably won't play it because of these dumbasses. Go read about tga's "sellouts" and watch the Swen's speech (which is not about the wukong), then choose if you want to play an amazing RPG, or not to play, just because some nationalistic *******s thinks presenter chooses who won the award.

The only game that got me same feelings as when I was a teenager (20 years ago).
Greatest game of all time.
Fuck incel chinese and black myth wukong

世一游 每一天都在期待更新 现在回想起沉迷博得之门的时光还是觉得很幸福。。全成就那天特别难受 不舍得拿最后一个成就 感觉拿到了就再也回不到这个快乐的时光qaq

Very fun game, combat is alright but story and world is great. Overall great game with so much replay-ability.

I finished this game yesterday.

I haven't had this much fun with an RPG since Neverwinter Nights, and I was freaking ADDICTED to its character creator, its campaigns, its ways to solve things, its battles, its adventures... it was the game that got me into D&D.

This game has just created a new generation of TTRPG Players and Game Masters. With the freedom a videogame can allow, you find characters you at first are confused by, but grow to love and treat like your brothers and sisters in arms. You feel a world breathe with life, as all actions you make reverberate down the line, in good and evil.

This is the kind of games we need in this era, more than ever.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? Possibly RPG of the Decade, reminds of Dragon Age Origins but even Better. Easy Recommend for RPG Fans and its mechanics are surprisingly easy to learn if you try.

Giving a positive review simply because the Chinese are review bombing this game because they think the Larian CEO hand picked the GotY at The Game Awards and wasn't just reading what was on the card.

probably the best game i've ever played. action is a lot more streamlined than in previous titles like dos2, but the story and voice acting in this game is just absolutely insane. even though you're playing from outside perspective, larian always finds a way to make the game feel intimate and so deeply involved with choice in dialogue and just choice in general, telltale2 is jumping in excitement seeing so many people be so interested in games that are story heavy. after playing this game for a week and a half straight, i'll defintely say that i've never felt more sad that there aren't any more quests to complete or more stories to bear witness to. i really do hope larian knocks these next few titles out of the park, im wholeheartedly grateful for getting to play a game like this, and i'm eternally at the edge of my seat waiting for more

Unbelievably unexpected plot twists. 
Interesting mechanics, fascinating characters.
Highly recommend this game!

Best game I've ever played. Loved it so much! You can really emerge yourself in the story while playing. Beautifully written. Great voice acting. Loved that the voice actor of Geralt in the Witcher 3 games voice Bhaal, awesome detail! I did a couple of different playthroughs, my first playthrough I missed so much details. But after 550+ hours I can say I probably dug up all the treasures and found most of the dialogue (and cats!). Made me want to play more games like it, but quite frankly... there aren't any!

Ngl, I was a little skeptical about this game's playstyle because I'm used to play games like Skyrim and The Witcher (more fast paced fighting mechanics).
Audio related opinion, I feel like there could be more voice interaction with your own character in the dialogue. Sometimes feel empty because you're only hearing the reactions of your choices. Rather than that, the game is really cool. It's the perfect amount of complexity. You can really bond with the characters you meet along.

After spending countless hours immersed in Baldur’s Gate 3, I felt that a review is in order. This game has completely redefined my perception of what a ‘game’ can be. Never before has a game impacted me to such extent and immersed into an unforgettable experience.

Having no prior knowledge with the Baldur’s Gate series or the concept of DnD, I approached this game as a newbie. At the time, I had only recently discovered DnD itself. When Baldur’s Gate 3 was recommended to me, claiming it was “better than actual DnD,” I was nothing but intrigued. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying BG3 even more than any of my DnD sessions.

Character Creation: An absolute beauty

The journey begins with a very satisfying character creation systems I’ve ever encountered. Whether crafting the most handsome character imaginable or a grotesque monstrosity, the choice is entirely yours. As a perfectionist and Sims player my whole life, I spent my first hour fine-tuning every detail to ensure the character I was about to embark on a long journey with was up to my standard.

I could explain in absolute detail how in love I am with a character creation but there is other aspects of the game that also need to be mentioned here.

Stunning Voice Acting and World-building

From the outset, BG3 captivated me with its phenomenal voice acting and a cast of distinctive, memorable characters. The open world is breathtaking, and travelling from place to place felt engaging thanks to the dynamic interactions between companions. (''A lover, perhaps'' waiting on Astarion in Baldur's Gate might be Tav after all dangers settle?) These moments made the world feel alive, as though events continued beyond my character’s actions.

The variety of companions available early in the game was overwhelming—in the best way. Choosing who is put in a camp time out and who get's to honourably go down to 1HP with yourself, truly magnificent. There were characters I would rather not be stuck with for the rest of the game so I was glad to find out that the choice is entirely ours.

A Rich Narrative

Initially, I was worried that the game’s 3 acts might feel too short. Completely false! In my first play-through, I rushed through the story, missing much of the content. By the time I reached Act 3, my under-levelled characters struggled, I struggled, the world struggled. It has prompted me to start over with a new save. This time, I embraced exploration and discovered just how much I had overlooked originally. Side quests, characters, combats etc. I have also finally got an explanation as to why some “bone man” had appeared in my camp out of the blue.

On my second play-through, I have decided to go against my dream visitor in Act 2 (minor spoiler: he says ''Stay away from a Githyanki). I faced Lae'zel awkwardly at that point. Because I ignored him this time, I have managed to get my pretty Tav hands on the Creche's treasure and well, get an absolute telling off from Astarion. Yes I know you were RIGHT THERE!

Endless Replayability

A single save can easily take over 100 hours to complete, especially with thorough exploration. Yet, even after finishing the game, I found myself longing for the character creation screen again and again. Imagining new play styles and story lines. The possibility of playing an evil character—perhaps a rogue striving for world domination while allied with Astarion only and the game ends with a happy ending (for me, obviously) as they kiss in the ash and bones of the fallen ones around them. The endless potential makes BG3 an unparalleled experience.

A Masterpiece of Game Design

BG3 pushes the boundaries of gaming in every aspect. Larian Studios has crafted a world that feels alive, with an astonishing level of detail in graphics, dialogue, and storytelling. The voice acting is exceptional; every actor delivers a performance that brings their character to life, whether lovable or loathsome. 

The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too. From the haunting beauty of the opening theme where ''Down by the River'' makes an uninvited appearance in my brain like the dream visitor (I tend to sing it at least once a week in my head, that song has made an imprint in my memory core) to the beautiful shifts in music during exploration and combat, it’s an auditory masterpiece.

Final Thoughts

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a groundbreaking achievement that has set a new standard for RPGs. Larian Studios on a fine evening, rolled a D20 with critical success and created what we know now as Baldur's Gate 3. The studio deserves all the credit for creating such game. It’s no surprise this title has been awarded for Game of the Year. 

The full price I paid felt fully justified, and the continuous updates from Larian are a delightful bonus.

For now, I’m off to create yet another character and finally embark on a durge play-through. Thank you for reading, and may your own adventures in BG3 be as unforgettable as mine.

El juego es muy bueno, por el poco tiempo que llevo jugado las posibilidades que te da son muchisimas.

De momento lo que mas me gusta del juego son: 

-La historia me tiene bastante intrigado
-Los personajes, son muy interesantes y tienen sus personalidades muy marcadas
-Gráficos muy buenos
-Las opciones de dialogo son muy variadas y tienen impacto en lo que sucede en la trama

Por otro lado lo que menos me gusta del juego:

-El combate, no es para mi, la cantidad de turnos que habré perdido porque mis personajes se resbalan o sin querer por lo grande que es el cursor les doy la orden de atacar a sus compañeros. Por otro lado se me hace super lento, sobretodo cuando son muchos enemigos. Y la cantidad de habilidades y magias para usar es apabullante, la primera puta vez que me encuentro una torreta se bugea y aunque este fuera de rango no puedo salir del modo por turnos para investigar.

Entiendo que sea este juego GOTY, pero por dios, que estresante es este juego....

The first game I've taken so long on the character creation screen. I'm amazed how many options there are!

First time ever posting a review on Steam and there is a lot to go into with this game so i will try to keep it as brief as possible. 

1. The first thing i noticed before even getting into the game was the soundtrack, BG3 has the best soundtrack my ears have ever heard in a video game in my 20 years of playing up there with 007 Golden Eye (IYKYK). It really sets the tone during gameplay as well as when you are customizing your character lets your imagination just flow hearing the soft fantasy folk like music while creating something you see fit to want in your play-through.

2. This game really pushed the boundaries and showed AAA Developers that when their is love and passion dumped into a game the people will notice. Larian Studios and the voice actors of this game are what this industry needs more of. Transparency, Love, Passion and Dedication was all seen in the making and developing of this game unlike other AAA Developers we have seen in the past as well as now, I'm talking about you Ubisoft, Activision, Blizzard, etc. 

3. If you are not a Dungeons and Dragons fan and have never played the table top before this is a perfect way to get 3 of your friends to go through a pre made story not needing a DM and enjoying the journey ahead. If you dont have 3 friends you can still play single player and or play with 1 or 2 friends and still enjoy the game just as much if youi had a full party.

4. Larin Studios listening to the community and adding a Mod Manager was next level for any player who has played multiple runs as well as adding new dialogue for companions like Minthara etc. in The character customization is good but with mods is really flushed out and adds a ton of options compared to base game options. Race/Class/Subclass are all interchangeable.

5. The gameplay and graphics are amazing, I have a Intel core I7 12th gen with 32 GB of RAM and a 3060 Graph Card and run the game on High graphics with 60 fps steady. The only gripe i have on this game is the level cap is too low base game and i think they should have made it a lvl 20 cap instead of 12 but with mods being a thing that is in the past for me since I can change that on the fly thanks to Larian Studios adding a Mod Manager in the game not only for PC but for console and MAC users as well which is such a next level step its crazy to see how far they are going to please their fans and i can not wait to see what they do with their own stand alone IP.

All in all this game to me is one of the best games to have been released in the last 20-30 years and will be cemented as an example to other Studios on what should be the standard across the board in the industry.

This game is so good it totally makes you forget the time and allows to to come up with the most silly ideas it doesnt give you clear steps it just gives you information which you sometimes have to find this game makes you work things out.  The charectures are so in depth.

I was a Baldur's Gate 3 hater without having ever played the game. I was a huge Zelda fan, and was angry this game beat Tears of the Kingdom for 2023 GOTY. How could it? Some dumb top down like every other dumb top down? Whatever. Jump forward a year and my younger brother purchases the game. In passing I just asked if he was enjoying it or not and gave my whole rant about it winning GOTY. He loved it and told me to get over myself essentially. Whatever. I GUESS I can try it. Can always get a refund. BOY. Was I wrong. This game has absorbed me from the get-go. 50 hours in and I'm still in Act 1. There is SO much content to this game it;s honestly ridiculous. All for one price? No paid DLC? No free DLC in a year that has the second half of the game? This was a groundbreaking game in 2023, and I simply missed it because i was being a loser. If you like DND, or any type of fantasy game for that matter, BG3 is a must have. So many play styles, so many different endings and avenues to take the story, I really cannot get enough. I see now how this turns into a multi-playthrough several hundred hour game. Try it for yourself!

I wasn't a fan of DnD combat until I played this game. If you're not a DnD fan, this game is a wonderful entry into it.

This is without a doubt my new favorite game.  It is incredibly immersive and so well done.  The writing, the graphics, the voice acting, it is just wonderful.  I'm on my 3rd replay and already planning for my 4th.  I literally cannot get enough of this amazing game.

This game has brought CRPG's into the mainstream light without compromising any of its vision. From the art, music, voice acting, etc this game is a bar above many. Then if you go through the game again with mods, it makes it even more lasting for years to come. 10/10.

This game is one of (or the) best game i ever played. The story is insane, the graphics are beautiful and all in all its just great <3

its a nice game to play, best for people who like choices matter games or who want to fight but dont have the skills , also co op is amazing , its not entirely like dnd, cuase the choices are limited, u cannot do anything your mind wants, but still the game allows you to do a lot of stuff other games dont offer
can talk to animals, thats always fun
can pickpocket your friends and enemies
STEAL  LIE  
TONS OF STUFF

This game is very immersive for role players. Your choices matter in how your story is written. You do not need to be familiar with DND to play. The depth of characters makes them engaging. The customization of your adventure from character creation to difficulty and options for approaching any situation make it playable for any level of gamer. This game has deserved the awards it has won. The music takes you places. The voice acting is fantastic.  There is a scene I have yet to make it through without tears after 2K hours of playtime on various platforms which is a testament to good writing, and how replayable it is.  I have purchased the game once for pc, once for console and once for a friend.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.

every voice role in this game is insane. characters that appear for 2 minutes and never again will put their whole heart and soul into their performance. great game and even more wonderful actors. 

put off buying the game for a like a year cause i didn't want to believe i'd actually like it. became very obsessed and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of gameplay.

Oh wow they weren’t kidding when they say this is the game of the year😭

Wonderful combat, storyline and designs
The game also gives you some space for creative approach??? LOVE IT. Easily the shortest 138 hours ever (i’m still in act 1)

How you don't already own this game and are wasting your time reading these comments is beyond me. This game is really a pinnacle of what games can be. The choices that you have are astounding, and every time you play the game you can (and likely will) find something new that you hadn't even seen the last time. Crafted with love and dedication, and with the time taken to make your choices in the game really matter to the story and experience. It is superbly acted in terms of voice content, and with the spread of changes due to your choices in this game make it all the more breathtaking. 

If it's on sale, buy it now! And if it's not then buy it anyways! Don't waste your time not playing this game. Stop reading this review and just dive into the adventure. Do it. You'll thank me later.

I LOVE this game. The story, the characters, the customization, everything about this game is a 10/10! the story is unique and fun and there are lots of different classes to chose from, making each play through feel a bit unique. The story is engaging and exciting and it is an easy to learn but exciting game for people who are new to gaming, or have been gaming for a long time. I highly recommend this game!

One of the best RPG's ever, can't believe it took me this long to start playing it, now I'm addicted, fantastic game.

Beautiful and amazing game, I feel like I can play it over and over and still try out so many builds. classes or have different story outcomes. The only downside I have found so far is the horrendous inventory management, a "Sort" button at the very minimum would've been perfect and the UI on the controller is not great. But that aside the game is definitly a masterpiece, from the playstyle, to the amazing voice acting and soundtrack and engaging story.

This was honestly one of if not the best game I've ever played the narrative design is so well done and immersive. This was my first time really sinking my teeth into (no pun intended) a turn based game. If you're new to turn base this is a great one to play! The major downside with this game is that it crashes every so often. Other than that I would highly  recommend this game for those who love great characters, immersive worlds, and fun ways to build a character.

Fantasy masterpiece. One of the best RPG I have ever played. Adventure for 100+ hours.

I have this game on two different platforms and I just love it. This studio has consistently raised the bar for video game makers. The detail and care that has been taken with the story and environment makes it worth the price and the replayability factor is high. Add the updates coming and I can see this being a game I return to over and over.

Larian Studios have raised the bar for what a video game can be to astronomical levels. I’ll be replaying for many years to come and likely still discovering new things. All the stars. All the praise. I cannot recommend it enough. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that brings the magic of Dungeons & Dragons to life in a way that’s accessible to everyone: even those who, like me, have always wanted to play DnD but never had the community for it. Larian Studios has created an experience that stays true to the spirit of the tabletop games while standing out as a phenomenal RPG on its own.

The story and characters are the heart of this game: from its gripping opening to the countless branching choices, the narrative feels deeply personal and immersive. The companions are brilliantly written, each with rich backstories, unique personalities, and moral dilemmas that make every interaction meaningful. Your decisions genuinely matter, shaping not only the world around you but also your relationships.

Combat is turn-based and played from a top-down perspective: blending strategic depth with the creativity of DnD mechanics. As a fan of games like XCOM 2, I love this style. However, I recognize the slower pace might not appeal to everyone.

For anyone who has ever wanted to experience the thrill of DnD without needing a dedicated group: Baldur’s Gate 3 is a dream come true. It’s a beautifully crafted RPG with tons of replayability, unforgettable characters, and a story that feels truly yours. I can’t recommend it enough.

One of the best games I played. Amazing story, choices and consequences and game play. Highly recommend this game.

Fantastic game. Fantastic devs. Thanks Larian.

Wonderful game with great story, fantastic characters and growth.
There's so much indepth work and love put into this game, I spoke to every animal i found and they all had something to say for themselves (i fucking adore it).
Much love and respect to the studio, actors and those that worked to make this piece of art <3

literally the best game i have ever played. thank you Larian for making such a beautiful game and a place for people to come and congregate.

Counter Negative Review Bomb. I love this game. Great Speech Larian Sven Vincke! On my 3rd playthrough.

Best game ever. It sets a new standard that other companies just cannot or wont meet. An amazing game in every way possible

Amazing game, great story and gameplay. No in-game purchases or garbage microtrasactions. New patches are coming every few months and add lot's of stuff.

300 total hours, but a good 60 were spent aimlessly roaming all of chapter 1 XD

I've never been that much of an RPG guy, but this is a masterpiece. Whether you take it slow or not; The first Act should impress anyone with the multitude of ways you can customize your solution to the problems.

I can [spoilers], [more spoilers], and [even more spoilers].

Of course I recommend this game.

My only complaint is it's too addictive. And inventory management sucks but that's true in most games. Beware - you're going to have too much fun and have to beat a 17 Wisdom Save to stop playing.

Finally, a game that lets me 1. hug the flirty sad boy 2. cry over the reflection of my bad religious experiences 3. gasp as 'the happy one' drops the most cinematic depressing lines of all time 4. keep TWO animals (and i can pet them both)

10/10 perfect game, no notes

Swen Vincke is an international treasure and the entire games industry would be improved dramatically if they would just listen to him.
Also, this game rocks.

bucket list game ; legendary multiplayer ; really needed dlc but it has mods ; invalid negative reviews ! plays 500 hours writes some crackpipe anecdotal negative review essay and then i mug they moms and rob their shitty apartment ; very much worth full price and multiple playthroughs

the game has a lot of choices so i think it is a great choice for those independent choice makers

Even after hours and hours, Baldur's Gate is one of those worlds that never gets old. Just when you think you've seen everything, some new surprise pops up to blow your mind.

Fantastic game, excellent world building and characters.

I bought this game for my girlfriend because the character customization and you can romance a vampire, now we are engaged and we play this game together almost every weekend.

Setting aside the excellent story, etc, this game is technically an inanimate object, and yet it is still a better Game Master than I am.  It's not even close, either.

This is the greatest game I have ever played in my life and very may well be the best game I will ever play. My love for this game is deep like my love for blonde Shart.

Such an amazing game. So in depth, I love the stories, every npc has something. Kill or don’t kill, you choose. The music is amazing as well. I’m in love, Don’t think there will be a better game. The mindset of Larian is on the right spot. Thank you for amazement.

I think it's fair to say after planning to play this a fifth time alone or with friends that this game is my favorite game and I hope Larian will continue to bless us with games with this much heart. I don't really have much to say, I love the voice actors, I love the story, the setting, the attention to detail. My only criticism is that I wish we could've played more of it.

The perfect game from the best studio. I love the impact Swen and his team is having on the gaming world. 

Incredible support, so many wonderful mods!

Can't wait to start my next run through BG3 :)

one of the best rpg i ever played in my life time great story game play great charters ect if your thinking about picking this game up all i want to know is why you thinking about it cuz at least for me it was a no brainer

To all my Chinese friends out there. Please learn some English as the broken translation of what the CEO of Larian Studio said is completely mistranslated. He never said word of mouth is pointless, it was in reference to publishers. So can we now stop review bombing Larian? We good now China?

Despite lacking co-op dialogue which NWN2 SoZ invented in 2008, Baldur's Gate 3 takes the seat as the best co-op cRPG. Larian has done amazing work here, the game plays smooth and clean, the rules implementation is 10/10 with a healthy amount of homebrew and all things considered, BG3 deserves it's place as the best cRPG yet released.

Sadly, there are also downsides: Characters are either hit or miss. The cut content and what was originally planned sounds so much better than what was delivered. Act 3 stretches on too long with inconsequential bits plenty. - Not that I'm saying I wouldn't've wanted more, but the way it was done felt like a major quality drop.

And despite all this, I'll rate Baldur's Gate 3:
    9.5/10



One of the best games of all time. Incredible replay-ability. Determined to finish an Honor run but haven't gotten past Act One haha.

I don't care for bear sex and a schlong selector but I'd be damned if this game wasn't the poster child for player choice. Impressive game all around.

Amazingly fun game, just like D&D. Your choices have consequences. Play from a variety of races and classes, with an epic story and learning the back stories of your comrades. Now..... roll for initiative!

I bought this as I was fed up of star citizen and wanted something different. Fantasy isn't my thing nor am I a D&D type, but this is by far one of the best games I have ever played. 

It truly is a once in a generation masterpiece and contender for game of the decade. Play it, stay with and you'll be hooked.

BG3 game me faith in the game industry.
