I got it when it came out, died a million times to tree sentinel. Rage quit, refunded, and came back this year and "got gud" now i love it!

good

Elden Ring Nightreign waiting room

Yes Just yes

The first play through, if you can surpass the challenges the game gives to you, will be great and you will be glad you bought it. However, this game has a new game+ feature that can keep you playing for weeks after you beat the game, but riding your horse everywhere all over again for hours, unsurprisingly, isn't appealing to everyone. The DLC is not for everyone and can be frustrating at times, but I recommend it if you want more of this game.

Best game


inconsistent mechanics

Best Game......

Beautiful and hard!!!

one of the most disappointing games i played after cyberpunk, i feel heartbroken

i farting love this game

incredible game ahead

Fuckin great

wow.

pretty sigma

pre easy

this game is so good but you need to pay some of your mental to play this game and good for child

What is the deal with this big picture nonsense? when i pushed the xbox button it kept taking me to a page to scroll through all my uninstalled games. I remapped the buttons in steam setting skipping over xbox guide button and now I can't use the xbox button to open xbox game bar or use the capture and share button. I haven't played on pc in a while. this is a joke. what genius thought this big picture worthless garbage up? I don't have all day and night to figure out settings in steam. I can enable the xbox button again through steam to open the big picture garbage but not the capture share button. I'm returning the computer I just bought and sticking to consoles. At minimum I won't be purchasing anymore games from Steam. I like elden ring it was too difficult but I can't recommend any game on steam if your planning on using a controller. All this was not an issue just a couple years ago. Take this big picture ignorance out of the steam app. its completely moronic.

One of the best games ever made 10/10

Probably a good game overall but the camera angle seems to be designed exclusively to irritate the players. Controls are confusing and can't be remapped. Best of all, inputs are registered on button release and not button pressed so have fun with input lag.

Enemies are pretty easy for a soul game and bosses are more "fun" instead of "frustrating" kind of challenge. Which compared to other soul games is pretty amazing.

But the irritation of fights above my weight Tree Sentinel being artificially difficult because crap camera and control lag is just too much for me.

Granted I literally at the beginning but I'd rather refund now when I can than keep playing to find out that the rest of the game is no better. Especially given how much complaints I saw about camera.

good game


Mind-blowing art direction - the game is beautiful in its every aspect.
It doesn't take you by hand and gives a unique sense of truly personal world exploration. It's one of those open-world games that you actually want to explore out of curiosity rather than your urge to clear all the question marks. Easily one of the best games. Perhaps, the best open-world one. 10/10. GOTY every year. Discount or not, play it.

when I was going to sleep last night I kept on dreaming about Melania's attacks and which direction & speed i need to go to dodge them.

üíï

Really disappointed in this game, as someone who has been a fan of Dark Souls since the beginning. These gems were so rich in detail and made perfectly start to finish mixed with iconic music. Elden Ring reused a lot of bosses/enemies and lacked with epic soundtracks this game just felt so empty to me.

good

It's peak.

Thee best.

i have only played for 24 hours but i love this game 11/10 this is my first souls game but its the best

masterpiece


I used to have friends now i have meat shields. and NIGHTREIN so close


yes

i havent beaten it yet but i am having the time of my life.v Definitley my new favorite game. I love the challenge of it and well ranni and melina ARE WORTH IT. Im not weird theyre just good charactersüíÄ. Ok serious tho i use to hate this game because it didnt support my ultra wide monitor and it was capped at 60 hz. But now that i have tried flawless widescreen its amazing and im mclovin it. NERF ASTEL Tryna finish Rannis questline k?

good :)

.

Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. Amazing combat, depth, and pvp systems. Highly recommend for any person looking to enjoy video games again

If I were to choose between the second coming of Jesus and this game, I would choose the game

be wary Tarnished

This game is wonderful
from getting bumf*cked by godfrey to getting pissed on by rahdan and his femboy it has everything you could need for losing the will to live until you finally win and go to the next boss to take it up the ass.

It is truly a symbol of perfection!!

very very much good cool

I can't believe I am finally playing it. It 100% lives up to the hype. Just wow. This really is the game that sets the standard for what modern games are. The graphics are good but honestly there are much better graphics out there. But this nails what makes a great game. The vibes. From Soft gets it

fun before and it is still fun today and my dad came back!

yep. its pretty good.

:)

The only thing that I disliked was how loose the story-line is. I usually prefer games with a more "set" path to victory. The game was also confusing at first and untidy. Either way, I still recommend this game to lots of people, as it is very fun.

not quite done with the game yet but having a blast

After 20 playthroughs, I can now recite every boss voice line.

Absolute perfection of a game.. Did not get the hype for a few months.. Played died over and over and gave up... Months later tried it and its one of my favorite games ever! 10/10 would cry again!

It's pretty good

After my hundreds of hours of playing the base game, Elden Ring had become a favorite of mine. Now, after hundreds of hours of playing with the Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring has become THE favorite. 

I love this game. I love the vistas and world design, I love the bosses and their level of complexity, I love the soundtrack, I love the voice acting and the characters they portray, I love experimenting with builds, and discovering new little details I didn't know, and crafting theories on the lore, and getting my ass handed to me in both pvp and pve, and challenge running it, and modding it, and playing speedrun bingo in it, and the community around it, and streaming it, and being in my friends' streams of it. Its not perfect, I have gripes with some balancing choices, some totally reasonable hitboxes, some features being underutilized, and some features left in the dust I wish they'd revisit, but its easily my favorite execution of FromSoft's signature action rpg style, so much so that its become my favorite game and likely my favorite piece of media, and I cannot wait to see what they do next. 

As a side note, I've purchased the game twice at full price and the dlc once at full price. Wait for a sale if you must but this is the most satisfied I think I've ever been with a $60 purchase, and while you could consider this in comparison to many AAA publishers moving to $70 or $80 price tags on release - let alone subscription or microtransaction models on top of that - Elden Ring earned my satisfaction on its own merits, not simply in spite of other companies. Also, my first 400 or so hours are on PS4 and as such are not in my count on steam.

wow!!!! so Amainggggg!!!!!!!

Amazing. Frustrating with challenges (A good thing don't get me wrong). 10/10 Highly recommend, if you don't you're a loser. Also just give it a try. Only live once. Worth it. Play w/ friends too, makes it better.

it angry me

:3


good


feeling of offing myself

This game made me feel like I did playing Skyrim for the first time as a teenager. Did not think that incredibly unique sense of wonder could be bottled and administered in adulthood, but Miyazaki and the FromSoft team made me feel like a kid again. 

I re-purchased the game on steam since switching from console, I have over 220 hours logged there. I am truly in love with this game.

Beware, 600 hours ahead!

not fucking fun

Game does have an Elden Ring but its broken. 


Wooooooow


After 87.6 hours + 22 hours in DLC,I don't feel like I've had enough from Elden Ring.
I played in STEAM DECK OLED.

Big Dragon die of rain

Bonk

I love this game on console, but here on PC, it used EAC (Easy Anti Cheat) that quite literally causes the game to perform horribly. Disabling EAC makes it a much more enjoyable experience, and got rid of all my issues with performance in game. Otherwise, an amazing game!

Too expensive, but very good

I am gay üé≠üß¶

gud

don't know how to write a review for this game, my favorite game of all time. better than sex

yes

game gud

I hate elden beast, everything can fly, and dog


Best game to ever be created. Miyazaki cooked and gave us a 5-course meal.

wonderful open world game. great if you like a hard game.

Dark Souls 3 might be a bit better but, many people say that their first souls game is usually their favorite. Elden Ring is a lot easier than Dark Souls 3 because in Dark Souls 3 you don't get so many souls

Very fun, has a ton of content.

ELDEN RING FUNNY HAHAHAHAHA

i fw it

You get rewarded for actually exploring the world and the challenging boss fights are so rewarding once you finally beat them. This is peak souls. This is peak gaming. Game of the decade.

This game is wild. If its on sale, 100 percent try it.

Great game, that being said, DO NOT BUY FOR FULL PRICE. It's a very unpolished game and isn't worth $60.

Gifted to me by an internet friend. First souls game I've played so everytime I discover a new area, I feel like I'm in heaven. Exploration is just fcking top-notch. I've had like 500+ deaths before finishing my first playthrough. Hands down the best game I've ever played.

elden ring

I first played on my Xbox and it was such a good game that i had to buy it again when i got on PC; along with the DLC. That 100 was well worth it and i don't regret it. Recommend it to anyone who likes challenging games that reward you for getting good and exploring

awesome


amazing

Amazing game, even though it's my first souls-like game. The environment and music are amazing, Especially loving the blend of an open world RPG and Souls game. Enemies are hard at first, but you can always come back later or be a pro gamer and just learn the move set of the enemies and dodge. Overall, great game.

i LOVE elden ring

fun try finger but hole

best game i ever played.

its elden ring

Yeah I mean, if you don't think this is one of best games ever made I really don't know what to do with you.

Perfect

11/10 The Greatest RPG Of All Time

One of the greatest games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Most boss fights feel like cinema, overcoming any boss you have been stuck on for a prolonged period of time feels like pure dopamine injection. As well as all that, it feels like a perfect introduction to the Souls-like genre, being easier in general than other games, but still challenging enough at times to give hardcore players just as much enjoyment.

10/10 Game

To this day, my favorite game of all time.

white mask varre finger fucked me

LOVED EVERYTHING:)

ZABITO BOGA

GOTY for a reason.

I really had fun with it, the world building, the combat mechanics and build you can do in the game are endless.

The DLC is tough to judge, the new mechanic of "leveling" system in the game is questionnable, but I still had an amazing time.

I await more games with this quality for 2025, that is my christmas wish

Amazing Game

very good game

Masterpiece but fuck melania

good

40 dead 1 hour 30 minutes for beat tree sentinel

A masterful experience in game play, you won't find many better examples of combat or exploration anywhere in gaming. Simply put, this is a Masterpiece. Elden Ring was my first ever Souls game. I originally brought it on PS4 and instantly became engrossed in the atmosphere and the challenge, i loved it so much i ended up getting the platinum trophy (my first ever). I then went on to play and subsequently platinum Dark Souls 1, 2 & 3, Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. After being wary of the Fromsoft games due to their reputation for so long, 'souls' & 'soulslikes' have become my favourite sub genre, and that is all thanks to Elden Ring.

In fact, it so good that despite playing  350-400hrs on playstation, i brought it again on this here Steam to work towards the 100%.. 

10/10.

game is dope i have over 1000 hours on my xbox and now i have 24ish on pc and the mods are sick especially seamless coop

fun game but very hard

Fromsoft continues in a direction I wish they wouldn't. They abandon their well-thought-out, small-scale level and combat design, instead favoring excess and bloat to the point where it stops being fun.

I miss DS2 more than ever. Bosses with natural, readable attacks, an absence of particle effect spam, and an open-concept level design that still felt deliberate (compared to the emptiness of ER's open world).

addicted pls help me

Playing this game feels like peeling off a toenail... in a good way???

yes


It was tough, for a moment, but then... IT WAS AWESOME!!!
P.S.: will be truly grateful for Ukrainian language in your next games :3

Fromsoftware has never missed

This game is a multi-level masterpiece. The game play is masterful, the music is masterful, the visuals/visual storytelling is masterful, and the story it tells would not be out of place in any library of great literature. This is EASILY one of the best games of all time, and a strong contender for the best game ever made. It's not an easy game, but it's not nearly as hard as people make it out to be either. Anyone who hasn't played this game is missing out on something profound.

10/10 - Being maiden-less isn't so bad, when you have this masterpiece to keep you busy.

+ The best single player game I've ever played
+ Souls-like combat has been fine-tuned to near perfection
+ Build variety
+ World & enemy design
+ Story

- Exploring in the 'incorrect order' can mess-up quest progression (during Liurnia of the Lakes, explore the northwest area of the map last)
- Quest progression can be obtuse, even by Soulsbourne standards
- Ashes of war could use nerfing with a timer to prevent spam

I have been playing this game for a while now and beaten it countless times and it was totally worth the experience. Although it's combat is not the best in the way you use your weapons it's amazing how you can make your own build to make the powerful hero that you always imagined you could be. Although hard at first, this game is very rewarding when you manage to beat it.

Fun game

CINEMA

Big pog yummers

Perfect

This game has good graphics and game play. The keyboard controls are decent but could be improved, as well as some of the animated sequences. And this game is hard. I've died the most in this game compared to others.

good game

I dont know how this game does it but I wanna live here even though everything is trying to kill me.

Oof, didn't think I'd be doing this, but the camera and pc controls are absolute garbage.  Didn't even bother finishing the tutorial since half the tutorial didn't work with the key combinations or actions it asked me to do.  It might be better on console but pc is a hot mess.  Prime example, pressing dodge half the time just made me run instead of dodge, attempting to circle the enemy made me run in the wrong direction cause of the camera and locking not working right, back stab never existed, blocking never existed, not really new to the whole hard core games this is just a mess

its a w

My first souls game and I loved this masterpiece.

First souls game I have played, thought it would be more difficult like people were saying, but I still enjoy exploring it.. Going in blind is very fun, mostly F around to find out.

Goodbye Free-time.

Super nice gameplay

id say one thing its good i guess but like be ready to open up 100+ guides to learn shit and ofc its a open world game so you can do what you want and get what you want is very amusing while ill say one thing before buying just put one thought into your head to Never Give Up as this boy oh boy is so hard i cant play shit and ill say one thing more that its better if you play with a controller as keyboard is very bad anyways try jumping
and it is overwhelming at first but youll get addicted after a while into the game prob after killing margit anyways fun game if you put your time into it without giving up and always rem you dont need to brute a boss you can just go do smth else to get stronger and kill the boss when youre strong enough to do so youll be prob better than me as i suck ass nah lol . might take a while to go find what then fuck youre supposed to do haha bye for now be wary of fire.


All of the great Souls/born feeling while respecting the players time 10/10 no notes

Best game I have played this year.

masterpiece

you just spawn in somewhere and are supposed to know where you're going and what you're doing. 
thumbs down for every aspect of this game. 
as you can see, i played 4 and a half hours of it and successfully completed NO plot points, and probably died 38827937 times. 
unfortunately, i do not have the patience for this. i also have a life outside of my computer. and lack the necessary time to be able to dedicate to this.
feeling a very small amount of dopamine every 7 hours when you finally find the next part of the story and/or kill something important is not enough of a motivator for me to play this game. 
this game may be for some people, but not for me.

I love dead simulator game

My favorite game of all time. So much to explore. So much to do. Infinite customization. Perfect dark fantasy game. I just with there were towns with friendly people to trade or interact with.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA oh its fun alright

It made western developers upset that they had to compete with it

Late the party...but can confirm...Elden Ring is indeed a masterpiece.

This game is a 2/10... camera: bad, movement: jank, input lag: abysmal. Story has left the chat. literally has nothing to go on, just throws you into a field after getting @$$ blasted by a random mob. Cool. If the controls and the camera actually wasn't hot garbage this might be playable. It's a real shame because graphically it's very very nice.

You're gonna die, cry, and quit a bunch of times. 10/10

This is what peak video games look and play like.

Elden Ring:
The culmination of decades of miracles at Fromsoftware all leads to ELDEN RING. An Open World RPG with stunning visuals, engaging combat, a well-crafted narrative, and near infinite repeatability. For non souls-veterans the mid-late game may feel like a grind, but even so the areas, mobs, and bosses delivered continue the passion a player has for the game. A well suited OST shrouds the Lands Between in it's beauty, with dynamic music that immerses the player in either combat, or moments of relaxation.

Shadow Of The Erdtree:
"mongrel intruder, thou art tarnished, it seemeth.."
Possibly the best DLC I have ever played for a game. At times it seemed like its own unique experience, separate from the gameplay of Elden Ring, while expanding upon the narrative in a satisfying and curious way. The DLC exclusive leveling system kept everything fresh, it did not feel like I was just taking my OP character for a cakewalk through new environments, but had an actual real challenge ahead of me. The DLC Bosses and OST don't disappoint either, and bring forth an all-new aesthetic and way to love the game.

yeah


One of the best games ever , that i have played. if you dont like it then get gud at it.

Elden Ring is overrated. I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls Remastered and Elden Ring doesn't give me the same satisfaction Dark Souls can. Elden Ring is beautiful but it doesn't hit the same way Dark Souls does. Being able to summon spirits feels super cheap and unskillful. Elden Ring is extremely difficult and I don't mind that but it feels like a chore to get myself to play the game. It annoys me that the UI disappears when you aren't combat logged. I'm trying really hard to like this game but I just can't. Dark Souls is so much better.

[b]‚ÄúThe Fallen Leaves Tell a Story‚Äù[/b]
Across my years of gaming, few experiences have truly surprised me. But exploring the Lands Between brought back a childlike sense of wonder.

The lore, characters, and world-building pulled me in completely, leaving me hanging on every word spoken and each scrap of text uncovered.
The difficulty was never unfair; instead, it pushed me to adapt, learn new strategies, and grow, rather than simply banging my head against the wall. 

In the end, the greatest gift Elden Ring gave me wasn‚Äôt only its unforgettable journey‚Äîit was opening the door to FromSoftware‚Äôs rich back catalog and a world of Souls-like adventures just waiting to be explored.

But none of them can bring your lost runes back...

Very good game. Would highly recommend if you always wanted to kill yourself but couldn't find a reason. This game will give you many.. But really one of the best works by Mr. Miyazaki the GOAT!

NOTICE: This Review Contains spoilers, nothing major but I know this is the kind of game people want to go totally blind into (which can be hit or miss in my experience) This review is also quite bad as I wrote it while sleep deprived and anxiety ridden on christmas holidays, wohoooo, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK

I've had this glancing from afar interest in souls games for many years now, lack of a good controller and hardware to play them on kept me from it, and then just disinterest in difficult games when life started getting more complicated.

I've tried DS1 Remastered almost a year ago now, didn't get far into it since I hated the controls and got destroyed by the skeletons at the graveyard, decided it's not for me and moved on. Couple of months later I try Elden Ring for the first time and... I don't like it. I went in totally blind and looked up nothing since so many people suggest going totally blind for your first playthrough. And I guess its a matter of personal preference but I was just completely lost, had no idea how character builds, upgrades or anything progression or combat related worked. I didn't even know dodge rolls gave you Iframes, my mind was operating on PS2 God of War logic where they're used to get AWAY from unblockable attacks, not rolling into them as you often have to do to avoid the sometimes ridiculous combos the bosses can pull off in this game. Got to Godrick and just got tired of being eternally confused, and dropped it just like DS1.

Few months pass, and I'm craving a good Action RPG, but I've always found Diablo-likes to be a bit dull combat wise, and against my better judgement I decide to give Eldy another try, but this time I'm NOT listening to what most people suggested. I need help? I look it up immediately. I write stuff down in a notepad to remember for later,
Aaand I manage to fix a horrible and unnaceptable performance issue that should not be a thing at all in a game almost 3 years after release, please spend more than 2 bucks and a tuna can on PC ports large AAA studios, the insane sales you got from this game could more than afford you to fix these issues and I'm not overlooking them just because I spent far too many hours looking for a simple solution (I had to disable the CPU Frequency boost feature in my bios, limiting me to 3.6Ghz, but thats OK I GUESS??)

Anyway, the game itself became really fun to play when I decided to help myself and suffer less. Early game was still a pain for me but once it 'clicked' I kind of got addicted for about 2 weeks, basically until I was close to beating the game. Yeah, that last part wasn't without merit, (LOCATION SPOILER AHEAD) after Leyndell, I didn't enjoy the game much, the northernmost part of the map seemed fairly empty, full of tanky enemies and bosses that did insane damage, forcing you to either be a god at dodging or go hard into vigor and get all the flask upgrades. Some of the mandatory endgame bosses made me lose kilograms of hair I swear (last and very dissapointing final boss sadly included SPOILER but Radagon Should've had two really cool phases, something like Godrick The Goated instead of having to fight a weird jellyfish very awkwardly after the former drains you of your flasks and irl mental and physical energy)

Anyway, despite all of this complaining I do, this game was probably the best one I played through for the first time in 2024. Unlike all the cookie cutter open world stuff released today with surface level rpg mechanics, I Felt like I was playing something that matters, that wanted me to explore, go out and discover stuff, something that made me wonder, first game since I played Morrowind that made me feel like that, and that's not something to ignore.

Well, that's it. I hope you didn't read any of this, if you did I'm sorry. I just thought the game deserved a positive review and needed to do something in place of sleeping. I will not be fixing mistakes as I did not care a single bit about what I wrote here. Goodnight.

This game is truly the greatest of all time. The gameplay is absolutely addictive, best soundtrack of all time and the combat is tough, yet rewarding. However, this was more than just a game for me; it was an escape from reality. Around the time I had purchased this game, I was in a pretty rough patch in my life. However, this game's beautiful world and environment immersed me in such a way that it felt like I was actually there in the Lands Between, and made me forget all that was happening irl. I cannot put into words how much this game has helped me, and I strongly recommend you purchase this masterpiece.

[h2]This game is a testament to the strength of video games as a medium for entertainment, art, and narrative. [/h2]

Elden Ring takes the niche "Dark Souls" formula and widens its target to the general audience by seamlessly incorporating an open-world structure. I think it paid off brilliantly, transforming the Souls experience into something far more expansive and liberating. The open world not only encourages exploration but actively rewards it, pushing players to overcome hurdles and uncover [b]huge[/b] secrets. This constant push to explore creates a satisfying gameplay loop‚Äîone that feels extremely rewarding, especially when you finally triumph over its daunting bosses. My first playthrough was special, and I couldn't rekindle the feeling in subsequent playthroughs or even the DLC, but I think there's true beauty in that.

But what I want to convey about this game, however- [b]what truly sets Elden Ring apart[/b], is its immersive worldbuilding. FromSoftware has always excelled at environmental storytelling, but this game pushes both the technical and artistic boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in game design. Rather than relying on exposition or handholding, the story is carefully woven into the world itself‚Äîscattered fragments of lore, cryptic dialogue, and environmental clues all come together in a way that exemplifies the [i]"show, don‚Äôt tell"[/i] philosophy.

Not to mention the level of detail poured into crafting Elden Ring‚Äôs environments- it's breathtaking. As an environmental modeler myself, I was blown away. The ruins, architectural motifs, and atmospheric design don‚Äôt just serve as backdrops; they are integral to the game‚Äôs narrative. Exploring these spaces feels like uncovering the remnants of a forgotten history, and it‚Äôs something rarely seen or executed this well in modern gaming. I legitimately feel like an archeologist when trying to tie in the story together when the graves of [i]elden[/i] civilzations are scattered here and there. I don't think I've seen it delivered in such a fashion in a video game before, and I've played [i]tons[/i] of single-player story games. 

For fans of FromSoftware and newcomers alike, this game is something to enjoy and spend your time on. If you're looking for enjoyment, difficulty, and awe, this game is definitely for you.

ALL THIS, but i love this game 100/10, miyazaki the goat

The biggest mistake I made when I first started playing was thinking that everything did a billion damage. They don't. Even the Tree Sentinel won't one-shot you at base vigor. So level up that vigor Tarnished! You'll have so much more leeway if it takes 3 shots instead of 2 shots to kill you.

this is the only game which has made me want to destroy my computer. its truly a great game 10/10

As an Elden Ring lover, I can honestly say this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. From the very first moment you step into the Lands Between, you're immersed in a world that‚Äôs as beautiful as it is dangerous. The open-world design is perfect, offering a vast landscape full of secrets, dungeons, and breathtaking vistas. It‚Äôs a world where you can get lost for hours, and it never feels like you're just going through the motions.

The difficulty is classic FromSoftware‚Äîchallenging but fair. Every victory feels earned, and even the smallest achievements are rewarding. The bosses are some of the best I‚Äôve ever faced in a game, each with their own unique movesets and strategies to figure out. The thrill of overcoming these giant foes never gets old.

The freedom in how you can build your character is also one of the game's standout features. You can experiment with different weapons, magic, and abilities, crafting a playstyle that‚Äôs uniquely yours. The combination of combat and exploration creates a perfect balance of excitement and satisfaction.

Graphically, Elden Ring is stunning. The atmosphere, soundtrack, and visual storytelling immerse you in its world. It‚Äôs not just a game; it‚Äôs an experience. Whether you‚Äôre exploring the desolate regions or fighting in epic battles, the attention to detail is incredible.

Multiplayer elements, while optional, add another layer of fun. I‚Äôve enjoyed summoning friends to help with tough bosses or even just invading other players' worlds for a little PvP action.

If you're a fan of challenging games with a rich story, atmospheric world-building, and a sense of freedom in gameplay, Elden Ring is an absolute must-play. It‚Äôs a game that respects your time and your skills, and that‚Äôs something truly special in today‚Äôs gaming landscape.

In short: Elden Ring is a work of art that will stay with me long after the credits roll. Highly recommend!

I like it, definitely much easier than the Souls games, so I'd recommend it for beginners

This is easily one of the best RPG experiences around. Use a walkthrough to guide you along your path fellow tarnished; and carefully anticipate the challenges that await you in the Lands Between. 

At the time of writing I'm currently just getting to Star-scourge Radahn at 100 hours. Ornamental sword(s) with some sorceries/incants and a shield. Take your time and find everything you can, as once you complete your first journey you can carry on your equipment and stats into the next.

And remember, this may be one of the LAST RPG's we get of this caliber. Enjoy it, cherish the artwork and storytelling that interweaves the Soulslike combat From is coveted for. I've tried many other games but this... this truly takes the cake when it comes to immersion and creativity. Thank you Miyazaki, R.R. Martin and the collective teams that worked on this; as someone who mostly plays multiplayer titles this brought me back to the days of midnight releases and Blockbuster. 

P.S do not fall to the frenzied flame....

Very fun, pretty game, i like collecting the stuff! It's a bit difficult but that's to be expected! All in all, good experience so far and i'm sure i'll keep enjoying it!

Hilariously, this game helped me cope with the death of my mom this year and I NEVER thought I'd enjoy a soulsborne game because I'm more of a "cozy gamer", but here we are. This is probably one of my top three favorite games. Highly recommend. Better with pals. Inspired me enough to make a silly comic series about my Tarnished and his adventures.

This was my first souls game. Just get past the fear of death and loss to experience something more.

most addicting souls game I've played! 

I haven't even started on the DLC yet I've put over 100+ hours in despite only having it a little over 10 days there is just so much stuff to do you never get bored

Wouldnt recommend to anyone who is currently employed, call it a skill issue

Beating this game using only a Strength build, especially after previously playing on a blood build with Mimic Tear, feels like a way to forgive for your sins. Jokes aside, this is one of the best Soulslike games out there right now,you should definitely give it a try.

Love the game...I played with the multiplayer mod....so my husband and i could play together. I find that gear doesnt seem to mater...its all about cosmetics. which is sad...nothing to work for...other than that it is a challenge, even with to of us, there were many close calls! The graphics are great and the art is different from what I am use too.

Elden Lord on PC has completely blown me away! As my first Souls game, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but this title exceeded all my expectations. The graphics are jaw-dropping, with stunning environments and flawless frame rates that make every moment immersive. The combat is incredibly satisfying‚Äîtight, fluid, and rewarding. Each boss fight is a thrilling challenge that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The world-building is rich, with fascinating lore and countless secrets to discover. Customization is fantastic, allowing me to experiment with different playstyles. The multiplayer features also add great depth, whether you‚Äôre co-oping with friends or diving into PvP.

Overall, Elden Lord is a masterpiece that has made me a lifelong fan of the Souls series. It‚Äôs a must-play for anyone looking for an unforgettable gaming experience.

Growing up watching Willow, the princess bride, the dark crystal and the lord of the rings trilogy it was a dream come true to explore a open world dark fantasy game like this. from cobweb filled castles to ancient ruins, haunted caves and mountains this game has it all. You can even go underground. The shadow of the erd tree dlc was also very fun to explore. combat in the soulsbourne games is the best as always and boss fights are very challenging but you will feel like more of an accomplishment for beating them. 10/10 really enjoy relaxing to elden ring after a hard days work

513.8 hours play time on Xbox.


     Critiques

- They reuse major bosses that obviously should be unique.
- SotE: The difficulty of mini bosses is increased by adding multiple small enemies, which is nothing short of frustrating. 
- SotE: The "Abyssal Woods" as it is, while in line with its lore, is gameplay-wise boring. 
- SotE: Major bosses "Commander Gaius" and the "Promised Consort" are plain trash gameplay-wise.
- SotE: After beating major bosses there simply is ...nothing, no hidden room, no secret item, no additional lore in complete contrary to the base game. Messmer, Bayle, the Promised Consort, etc. it doesn't matter how important the boss is.


The biggest draw of Elden Ring for me is the exploration of this breathtaking, mythical world filled with hidden places, secrets and gods to slay with badass looking weapons in badass looking armor while beautiful music plays in the background. 
Sadly Shadow of the Erdtree i misses the point "Exploration" when it comes to the boss arenas and learning that it is common for Fromsoft to do so in its DLCs dampens my eagerness to play its other games. Overall it seems incomplete, so adding the other critique points, while it is still well worth the price, I, as much as it pains me, can only give Shadow of the Erdtree an 8.5/10. 


I absolutely suck at this game and regret never being able to play Elden Ring for the first time ever again. 10/10

As the new player in the souls series, this game is the perfect way to start! Combat is fairly challenging so it doesnt feel like the game is easy or too difficult. Everything from the normal enemies, hidden places to explore, boss fights and all the areas to explore and to look around is AMAZING! Even after only near 80h in, i fell in love with this game and i recommend it to everyone!

Uno de los juegos que mas le e dedicado en mi vida y orgullosamente complete al 100# en mi unica run. El juego base es una obra de arte, lo mas sercano a la definicion pura de Aventura donde no importa lo avanzado que creas estar siempre ahi una cueba que no entraste o una masmorra que no descubriste. La historia es impecable y toda la experiencia es fantastica. El Dlc ofrese un duro desafio pero sus recomepnsas en todos los nives lo compensan. Peca de no estar tan bien dise√±ado como el juego base en varios niveles pero nunca deja de sorprender aunque esta lejos de ser prefecto. Secciones de forzado plataformeo espantoso, muchos savepoins muy mal hubicados, algunos enemigos exesivamente mal intencionadmente colocados sin nesecidad y la final la cual A DIFERENCIA DE TODO LO DEMAS EN EL JUEGO tiene muy limitadas formas de lidiar con ella y si te salis de ese limitadisimo esquema es preaticaemnte imposible. La parabola del juego cae mucho en el final por estos factores PERO AUN ASI estos errores no terminan de opacar la grandiosa experiencia que te ofresen. Impresindible para todo el mudno y posiblemente el mejor juego de su generacion y con diferencia

It is my video game crack fr. 500+ on PS5 before I got a PC; and no, IDK what a woman or grass is.

The first 60 hours of this experience have been the most fun I have ever had playing a video game. It is far from perfect, but I would be lying to you if I said this game wasn't a masterpiece in my eyes. This game isn't for everyone, but I still implore you to try it out. This game is a masterclass in exploration so going into the experience blind is a necessity if you want to enjoy a huge chunk of what makes this game special. 11/10

Elden Ring is among the weakest of the soulslike games and ends up outclassed by other options, but is still worthwhile. There is a reactionary approach to enemy design here where most are centered around punishing habits developed in Dark Souls 3. This isn't bad if you're coming from said game, but isn't entertaining in it's own right. It's also the weakest story of any soulslike, despite having the most story of any of them. The game's open world nature doesn't justify itself and is instead a boring chore to move through as you explore, and then "rewards" you with instant fast travel when backtracking. You're given a mount for the first time ever in one of these games, but it's combat is only slightly more sophisticated than what can be found in Skyrim. There are also the two vestigial limbs of crafting and stealth which are so under baked that they might as well not even be here. As for visuals, the game requires Flawless Widescreen, Reshade, and low settings to not be painful to look at. This is also the most blas√© Fromsoft OST, and I say that as a big fan of ambient music. I actually play with music muted because of how the ambient tracks drone on. Lastly, performance is pretty bad even when testing with FPS uncapping mods on a 7800X3D and 4080 Super. Note that raising your FPS cap comes at the cost of disabling all online functionality, but considering the online features are toned down from previous games it isn't as much of a loss imo.

Overall, ER is good at a lot of things but isn't really great at any one of them. I would have said it's the best soulslike to start with because of that, but it's enemy design throws a big wrench in that. Reading this review probably has you wondering why I'm giving this game a thumbs up at all. The truth is that ER is built on the shoulders of giants and has a very strong core gameplay loop that carries it above the recommend line. If you want to start here, that's fine but just know that there is nowhere to go but up.

250 hours in on PS5 and got the Platinum trophy. 10/10 would platinum again on PC!

its very addicting even tho i want to physically die with how annoying these bosses are

This is #1 game I've ever played. I played this game on my Playstation and i beat the game at least 6 times. The games story is immaculate in a million different ways possible. I hope you enjoy this game like I have.

This is my first Souls-Like game and it has been well worth it.   While i cant say I agree with all the design choices in this game, what they've create undeniably WORKS.

This is a modern-day masterpiece and an instant classic.   The level design, tone, challenge, and sheer scope is incredibly impressive.  WELL WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.

Although some aspects of it frustrated me because so  much of the mechanics are hidden or not explained, and i tried to play this game  as blind as possible,  it was hard to do it totally blind because:

1) There is no quest tracking, if you miss a line of dialog even if by accident, it is not possible to see what was said, and obviously there are no markers on where to go to progress any of your quests.   There are no cheat sheets here (except looking stuff up online).  The game does NOT hold your hand in any way.   Your choices matter, even when you don't even understand you've made a choice, such as certain quests getting locked out based on your progression elsewhere.

2) i found it very hard to manage the lock-on, which 'breaks' intermittently during combat and it also jars the camera around in wierd ways

3) I found the horse (Yak?) to be extremely 'bolty' where the slightest nudge on the d-stick will send it flying off a cliff in situations where finesse is needed.  I've fallen to my death a ton of times (especially on the 'tree' level i'm at now), and it has been frustrating in some cases.

4) the dodging/rolling mechanics are rough, combined with the relentless onslaught (agression) of the bosses.  I'm guilty of more than a little panic rolling an alhtough i have 200 hours into this game at this point, i feel like i'm still a complete novice at the combat.  Very challenging.   I still have yet to understand how experienced players are able to accurately dodge such a large sequence / variation of attacks on the bosses considering the wide variety of attack actions, timings, and the sheer quantity of bosses.  

5) being a PC gamer primarily with a background in MMO's and other RPGs, and playing mostly with keyboard/mouse for nearly all of my prior rpgs,  i found the way that your manage your hands/attacks/items to be clumsy.    I figured it was a controller specific issues, but when i looked at what the available keybinds were on a keyboard, it is clear this was a design choice..  You will not be able to simply bind year 'healing flask' to a specific key.  You have to cycle through all the items in that slot and make sure it is selected before you 'use' that item.    I understand why this was  done but damn can be pretty frustrating being run down or using the wrong item (seal instead of shield, etc) based on what was selected.  You really have to plan ahead and when things go badly it is really difficult to recover.   

6) Finally, it surprised me how many items/skills or spells seemed not be be very balanced.  After dabbling with a strength build (about 50 hours) I rerolled with the desire to really 'learn' the machincs.      I switched to a dex build and tried going strict buckler/dagger --- and struggled quite a lot.   It was very hard to understand why I was getting hit by bosses, as the game doesnt provide much feedback.  Did i mis-time my parry?  Could the move not be parried?   Hard to tell!     I seemed to take lots of damage from margit even when i felt i got the parry off, and the boss was not stunned even when i heard audio cues indicating i pulled the move off.  This was confusing.  After switching to a 2h curved sword, the game instantly got 100x easier.   I also rolled a mage character and again the game was 100x easier.  Intuitively it feels liker the game needs better balance (for the ashes, and for spells), but it really does force you to experiment.

This game deserves its reputation of being very hard.    

If it sounds like i'm trashing this game, i'm not.    What i've stated above are impressions/areas where i personally struggled as someone not famliar with any fromsoftware games or even any other soulsborne titles.   However,  all that effort has been worth it -

The level design(dungeons), settings(locales, themes), graphics(lighting, shadows, etc), lore, encounter design,  music is probably the best i've EVER seen in a game.     And although it is challenging, it has been rewarding.  I wish i had played this sooner - I already bought the DLC, and i'm a little bit afraid!!

Arguably the greatest game I've ever played, and this is my first souls game. I've always ignored them because dying over and over is not something i find fun, but I wanted a game to challenge myself. It was difficult, but not too bad.

The exploration is on another level from other games. The world is absolutely beautiful and also humongous. Hundreds of weapons and many different play styles to choose from. Secrets are everywhere. I missed so much and the game took me 90 hours to beat, I cant wait to try the expansion and the bosses I missed from the base game

I have like 700 more hours on Xbox, easily one of the best games of all time, in contention for the number 1 spot for me. I've played through this game over 10 times and it never fails to give new challenges and even greater feelings of success. The replayability is top notch too, I can start a run as soon as I finish one just so I can try new weapons, but there is nothing like taking a break for a while and then returning to re-experience it. Easily one of my favorite autistic obsessions.

Surely one of the best games I've ever experienced. 

Pros: 

- Combat system is almost perfection

- The world is gigantic, even the optional areas alone are bigger and more packed with content then most of modern AAA games

- Exploration, very rewarding and fun (first playthrough especially)

- Soundtrack, as good as always

- Tons of different builds, weapons and other stuff

- Insane replayability 

- Malenia, Radahn, Maliketh and Mohg fights, absolute cinema

Cons: 

- Recycling of the bosses can be an issue for some

- FPS drops in Leyndell

- Too much AOE in a few fights

- Dungeon bosses are meh 

9.5/10

I own Elden Ring on PC, PS5, and XBSX. I have beaten this game probably close to 30 times (non-dlc) and the dlc I have beaten once (taking my time and also took a break). It is one of the most beautifully crafted games i have ever played. I am guilty to quitting when I first bought it (on PC) but since purchasing on xbox and then ps5, I have become addicted! Great story, amazing boss fights, variations of enemies, biomes, etc. Just a fantastic game to play.

Don't let Margit (first boss) ruin your play through. It just requires lots of side quests to be on par with the demi-gods. What you experience with in souls games is called failure and without it, We wouldn't improve, nor learn. Other than that, this game is a treasure, especially in 2024.

games really good would recommend but of my 4 characters 2 of them one with 90 hours and the other with 30 hours game time both save file corrupted so ive lost all my time and effort on them i love the game but this is so frustrating and when this happens there seems to be absolutely nothing i can do to fix it and get my characters back.

great game highly recommend great quality,story,gameplay

Reasons why this is the best game ever made
1. this helped me memorise the attack patterns from my dads belt
2. Secret dung eater sex scene makes it worth the buy
3. Download Ranni sex mod for best experience

only downside is i cant romance morgit. unplayable

in this game you can: die to a boss before you get 1 hit off than 30 minutes later beat him while dodging most attacks (also play this if you like seeing the death message for 1000 times)

10/10

Very difficult, very fun. Would reccomend to any challenge seekers.

The exploration in this game is absolutely incredible. ,,I bet there's nothing at the end of that old broken ledge". +1 hour spent in secret location.

already completed it on xbox, one of the best games ever but the 60 fps cap and no support for ultra wide is trash

A true masterpiece... FromSoftware never ceases to amaze for more than a decade now. Keep up the good work!

This is my honest review for Elden Ring (2022). I never understood why this game was so popular, but this is truly a case where you have to play & complete the game to understand that. On the outside, this game just looks like another Soulslike made by the pioneers of Soulslike games, fromsoftware. That isn't the case at all, this game has it's own story, gameplay, and feeling. It does feel like Dark Souls at points but that's only because of the combat/controls but there are SO many weapons to play with and with that, SO many different spells/incantations. My favorite thing I would say is the open world environment, the open world is huge with many places to explore and many unique enemies in those places too. I loved exploring the caves and catacombs, probably one of my favorite boss fights in the game was just chilling in a cave, Astel. There is a downside to making a world that big while trying to create a good story though, it gets really confusing especially when you first start this game. It is a very confusing process when you start but just trust that process and just know it won GOTY for a reason, it's a good game with a good story that explains it self when exploring new places. The ending & end game was very worth all the rage & suffering. To point it out, end game was incredibly fun & satisfying. I was mad throughout most of the game, just fighting boss after boss. Once I got to the point where most enemies were pretty easy to kill, I started exploring way more and started enjoying it way more. I felt more powerful as I played the game, one thing this game does really well. 9/10

Pros
-Great colours
-enemy diversity
-runs well
-lots of different ways to play
-interesting plot
-has a map
-can play at your own pace
-fun with friends
-challenging
-memorable bosses

Cons
-no ultrawide support
-engine is a bit dated
-sometimes you need a guide or walkthrough


Enter game, die 99 times in a bossfight you are underleveled for, rage quit, try again in 10 minutes. 10/10

This game is really fun, there are so many cool weapons to use and so many things to kill. However there are some bosses in the game that will be a super challenging fight to overcome but it's the most satisfying thing ever when you beat them. Play the game, have fun, get out there and become Elden Lord.

12/22/24 - So far of my gameplay, the game is alright, pretty hard because it's a "Souls-like" game, which is something I like. So far, it's pretty good

I thought everyone giving this game the gawk gawk deep style were wrong. I'm a guy that bought Dark Souls 2 on release for $60 and sold it back to Gamestop a week later for $30 of in store credit. Safe to say I was pretty donezo with even trying again with these kinds of games. But after seeing Geoff Keighley publicly just bounce on this games D with no shame I thought to myself: "Maybe there's something here....maybe I want to bounce on it..." 
I am writing this review because I am bouncing on it. You should bounce on it too. It has converted me. It has all clicked. I now know why people bounce on it with no shame.

yeah this is a game for masochists
interesting lore but complicated af for no reason, cant explore **** because everything and everyone is trying to kill you, the input queuing (attack, dodge, etc) only works in the most inconvenient times and is really delayed, you have to play this game every day or you'll have a bad time the next time you play after a couple days because you lost the muscle memory
honestly it's not a bad game but if you're an average casual player and not really into souls games, skip this one and play something else, you're not missing anything

The coop mod makes this game the best. Me and my girlfriend do multiple playthroughs already and I can never get bored of this. 


I want to lick ranni's feet.

i realized my real life problems were about nothing after i came to the lands between. Only a handful of people are actually nice to you and the rest want to introduce your stomach to their ancient weapons of the sort. wish i could stay here forever.

I have never written a review on Steam before but out of all the games I have played Elden Ring lives up to the hype. Would recommend (MASTERPIECE).

Elden Ring is one of the greatest games Ive ever played. I didnt want to play it for the longest time because I never understood why people would want to spend so much time on one boss... until I played it. The feeling of defeating a boss you spent so much time on, understanding their moves, and your own more and more to finally overcome the challenge is an amazing feeling. But the story, elite, the exploration, elite, the weapons and techniques you can get, elite. Easily a 10/10 game.

Simply amazing. Game of a generation worth a second play-through on PC.

awesome game takes a lot of time to play but always has action and is always fun

Play the seamless Co-op mod if you want to play with friends, peak game in single-player
trust me (BT reference)

There is no explanation needed and honestly if you have yet to play this game I promise you will not regret it. The only thing I regret is looking certain things up, I think its better to play this game without looking things up unless you're REALLY lost.

Genuinely a huge step up in accessibility in the souls-borne series. Where in previous games the clunky controls and stiff responses made playing the games a chore and more akin to trying to fly fish in quicksand, this game feels like a breath of fresh air. The difficulty is still there, but it's a refreshing challenge that feels attainable.

A beauty of a game, and one that lives up to the hype. Hopefully we get a part two and Fromsoft will embrace what the community created with the Seamless Co-op mod.

the game is super hard but you never wana stop playing
ALSO MAKE SURE TO WATCH TUTORIALS LIKE ELDEN RING TIPS AND SUCH

For some reason whenever I launch this game its super zoomed in on a portion of the screen and i cant even press the play button or do anything

pros - incredible world building and boss design
cons - too many repeat bosses

Wow what a game:
 - found out I am Maiden-less
 - realized level only matters slightly, lack of skill matters most
 - bleed hurts, but death-blight also hurts, so does fire and poison, actually, everything hurts
 - I'm in love with a witch, a maiden, and a one arm swordstress
 I hate this game. Love this game. Want this game. Refunded this game 2 times. And now don't want to play anything else. 


awesome game, highly reccommend. very grindy and unforgiving fyi.
