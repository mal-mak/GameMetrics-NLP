Despite the numerous crashes, bugs and inconveniences I have experienced in my 45 hours with this game (still in 2024), I would still recommend it. It is a love letter to video games and how great they are at telling stories and experiencing freedom. The best true open-world sci-fi game out there. Not always my cup of tea, but I definitely enjoyed my time with it. 



great graphics, love the gameplay

Too good to be true

game took 30 hrs of my time in 3 days

Spent a couple of hours just trying to get past the red logo screen on Ubuntu (downgrade to Proton 7 helped). Then got stuck in the cut scene after the training simulation. It stutters horribly and there is no way to proceed with the dialog or get out of the car, there is an "action" button in the usual place for dialog options, but no actual option is present, and nothing happens if I press F.

10/10 game will keep you occupied for hours, the visuals are absolutely stunning and the gameplay is amazingly smooth

Takes a little while to get into and immersed, but the writing, character upgrade systems, combat, is all great.  Sometimes the world feels too big, and it would be nice if there were more interactions that could be had with regular NPCs.  Most important thing though, this game has heart.

good game

the game is very much fun


10/10 would recommend to a choom

so many patches later, still numeroues quantity of bugs, glitches, poor optimization. rage quited after another gameplay bug that made me failed side mission

Meh. CPR is for normies now.
W3 sucks too.

Cyberpunk 2077 is hands down one of the coolest games I’ve ever played. Night City feels so alive—it’s packed with details, amazing characters, and this insane, futuristic vibe that just pulls you in. The story is super engaging, and the choices you make actually feel like they matter, which makes it all the more immersive. Visually, it’s stunning, and the music and sound design really nail that cyberpunk aesthetic. It’s a game you can sink hours into and still feel like there’s more to uncover. Honestly, if you’re into futuristic, open-world games with a great story, this is a must-play.

Good game.

Despite the imperfections, Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games ever made. Fight me about it

the game is good, the dev spent a lot of though and time on it, but i feel it is unfinished game, like some things does not feel right, physics is weird, objects walk through the player, i mean if you take it in a nice way, you'll enjoy it, because the drama and the story and the action is fantastic, but it could use some love in a way the bike handles, or the car, sliding or drifting, characters will walk to their programmed path whether you're in the way or no. overall great game, but unfinished.

amazing

I waited 4 years for them to get things straightened out, and reviews seemed to indicate it was amazing now.  I wish Steam had a sideways thumb...  It isn't a bad game, but it is the very definition of "overhyped".

No, the graphics are not as ground breaking as reviews suggest.  They're good, but nothing new.  The gameplay is what I would call "fine", as it's just your typical open world, run errands sort of game.  I spend most of my time talking to people, or answering the stupid phone.  The shooting and most of the movement is weird, like there's a very small delay - especially with crouching, which is about a 50-50 shot if it works first click or not...  Can't comment fully on the storyline, since I'm bogged down in "wait for this person", "call this person", territory.  So far, I'm not really engaged by it.  The world itself is nicely crafted, but even with all the NPC's running around it just feels "dead", as if some computer crafted what they thought the world would look like in order to keep a person happy while they were imprisoned in the matrix.  Which I suppose may be correct, since Night City is essentially society gone wrong due to technology.

Worst part:  Bugs.  Wow, this game must have been miserable when it was first released if people are saying this current version is great when it comes to bugs.  NPC's react very strangely, things pop in and out sometimes, cars spawn upside down, characters fall through the floor or clip into each other, physics objects randomly explode, items clip into each other...  It hasn't been game breaking yet (apart from my car spawning upside down half the time...), but it is absolutely immersion breaking.  Every time I start to get into it finally, some character is walking around on their head, or my car spawns incorrectly, or whatever else, and I'm out again.  I can put up with a bug here and there in a game, but we're talking a couple per minute here.  If this was an early access title or a day-one release waiting on a patch, I'd say it was pretty good for the size of the game.  But 4 years later?

Is the game worth playing?  Eh, I suppose, if you're into the setting.  I'll finish it, most likely.  However, even at the $27 sale price, I'd say it's a hard sell unless you're just REALLY into the setting.

This game is great for first person view Game lovers! High-end graphics!

Great game, a little buggy at times. Still. Cant sex Johnny.

Goated

This game is a must have for any gamer out there. The story is gritty and grounded with twist and turns. Companions that are interesting and feel relatable to our modern world. The leveling system feels engaging and dynamic, like a true RPG, it can set you down a path of how you want to play the game and take on missions. From hacking and stealth, to all out brute force with mantis blades and heavy weapons. The combat is fun and fast paced. All and all the game looks beautiful to look at on those high settings. It is a massive improvement since launch and with the DLC, it is worth giving it a second chance for those that felt less than satisfied on launch. It is by no means a flawed-free game, like any game it has bugs. The dialog can  have a lot of choices...but they all lead to the same response. The driving can feel awkward and lumbered at times. The world feels a bit empty, there aren't many places to visit in the city aside from shop vendors. Johnny is straight up unlikeable and borderline annoying at times. However, these negatives aren't enough to take away from the amazing expereince that cyberpunk offers. Backed up with a blood-pumping, foot-stomping tracks to get you through those fights, along with sensitive tracks to go along with forlorn moments. Along with radio stations to enjoy with a variety of different types to chose from, Have a blast in this world. You won't regret it!

Cyberpeak 2077

post-game depression has me *revisiting* the *store page*, so might as well leave a review LOL. This revived my love for gaming. Period. 

NOTHING will feel like a chore in this game. Side quests reveal stories that could damn well be their own main story line. Idk if you can relate, but I'm a guy who developed a kinda ADHD method of speed running story-driven games -- I never thought I'd care to do something like read data shards to learn more about the world CDPR made for us. 

If you're a fan of the cyberpunk genre, this takes it to 1000. If you like thoughtful dialogue/interactions, you will feel the consequences of in-game actions rippling into your chest. The environment/story/characters/gameplay are all just so rich that you surely won't regret taking it slow & investing your time into living this experience.  At one point this game will have you going from telling your friends, "Can't hang tonight, playing Cyberpunk.", into , "Sorry, out of town. I'll be IN Night City.". XD

Only thing I disliked was the length of main story. Didn't wanna leave Night City

Good Game. I want to live in this reality

I went into Cyberpunk 2077 wanting to love it. The game is undeniably beautiful, with an incredibly detailed world that’s a feast for the eyes. The neon-lit streets of Night City are immersive and alive, showcasing a level of artistry that few games achieve.

However, despite the visual brilliance and the presence of Keanu Reeves, the story just didn’t grab me. I found myself struggling to connect with the narrative or care about the characters, which made it hard to stay engaged. I even pushed myself to play longer than I truly wanted, hoping something would click, but it just didn’t happen.

It’s clear that Cyberpunk 2077 has its strengths, and I can see why others enjoy it. Unfortunately, for me, the story wasn’t compelling enough to keep me playing, no matter how gorgeous the game looked.

Must-buy it while it's only $27. I just had to stop to write this review out of complete awe for Cyberpunk. During the 4 years I waited for this game to reach its final form, I completed games like RDR2, Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legends, I didn't think any game could out-do any of them and that made me sad. Thankfully, 2077 is yet again raising my standards for what a "video game" can be.
Now is the time to plug-in, this game is f*&king incredible.

itts kinda mid

Game was fun but Ready or Not was also on sale

best far cry since 3

Masterpiece in 2023 :)

hell

Good game. You can try it.

I mean it's ok

Very fun

i cant put to words how AMAZING this game is. bravo.

I've waited from release till today to try this game and i have to say, compared to the hours of videos i watched about it years ago, it has aged like fine wine. Literally just played for like 5 hours straight without anything weird or bugged and man this game is something. Glad i finally gave it a go.

i love how the story is and all the options just wish there was more and more excitment like what if there is a mission for v to time travel or maybe one ending where you have to try and make or find johnny a body or more side missions that involve more about night city

It's very immersive; you feel a lot of empathy towards the characters in the game.

early game: get f*cked up by anyones hacks and blades
mid game: f*ck up everyone by hacks and guns
late game: BLACK WALL HACK WHAAAAAT
end game: end everyone just by hacking

Effectively GTA but in the future, an extremely complex game, and with brilliant graphics, so far the story is good.. Overall I love the game.

Beyond heat i love it

Very interesting game! Cool musik, nice gameplay

Wake The F Up Samurai, We have a City to Burn....

Panam

Night City will surely leave you with some unforgettable memories. The game has a great story, well-developed characters, and a highly detailed and beautiful world. The DLC is the missing piece that CDPR added to perfect it.

cyberpunk made me cybercry(david if peak)

The Star is canon and you cannot convince me otherwise.

 its great

Woke up slaughtert scavs then played cyberpunk

10/10


Cyberpunk will forever be "up there" when talking about my favorite games. The atmosphere and the way Night City feels and looks will definitely leave you with some unforgettable memories. The game has a great story, likeable and well-written characters and a very detailed and beautifully crafted world. Combine that with the DLC and you're set for hundreds of hours of amazing gameplay.

Best game ever played

crazy?? i was crazy once


Best game ever

punk 10/10

game so good it made me pregnant

It still blows my mind today this game came out since 2020. The graphics are mind bogging. You have to see it your self. There are videos on youtube and if you think it looks that good. It's even better on RAW footage. Youtube does compression on videos and blurs it some. Get your self high quality HDR oled; you wont regret it.

x

So many options and such great music. I love the cyberpunk world and this is a great additon to it.

wonderful game, good comeback, the DLC is a HIGH recommendation, some bugs can happen but besides that, night city is just your imagination!

best graphical and story game ik

There's no way one wouldn't enjoy the game in its current form. There's so much to do, with many different play styles for you to choose from.

When this game first came out, I laughed at how horrible of a state it was in. It was awful.

Fast forward to today, I have eaten my words... this has become my favorite game of all time. Everything from the most interesting open world I've ever played in, the incredibly awesome story, the best photo mode in any game and COUNTLESS mods to play around with. Even after 400 hours Cyberpunk has never gotten boring for me. This is the one game in my steam library that I never uninstall.

Is it perfect? No. But There is NOTHING else like it.

And they KEEP updating it!


Wonderful game!

Absolutely Breathtaking

10/10 anime 10/10 game very addicting best 26 dollars ive spent in a while

:)

amazing

Johnny Silvercock is the best part of this game. Buy it if you like fun games. 10/10


What. 
A. 
Masterpiece.

Great world building
Serviceable story
Mid combat
And then, the bugs, glitches, and bad animations
Seeing a bug per quest won't cut it for me

I tried playing this game back in 2020, but it had so many bugs that I ended up stopping.
Now, though, it feels so much better and [b]I’ve gotten a real kick out of playing the main story[/b], love this game and Panam Palmer as well :)

Engaging story, gorgeous graphics with great gameplay and mechanics. 

pretty soild icl

best game oat

one of the best games ive ever played!!!

Good game overall and have way more hours on Xbox. Modding the game was super fun but steam forcing me to update the game against my will broke them all. I can't play it anymore.

I like this game. It was a mess when it launched but now it is one of the best game

Still a broken piece of slop 4 years after release. Unbelievable.

Bought the game to enjoy the story. 
After 2-3 main quests, ditched the story and started pursuing side quests. 
45/59 hours spent on side quests, and another 10 hours spent on killing cops. 
Break. 
Watched Edgerunners. 
Got THE jacket.
Chasing the moon now. 

10/10

One of my all time favourite games. Running great on my ROG Ally X too.

Wonderful game, I've never wanted to stay up till 4 AM to finish as much as I could, especially in a single player game, but I truly appreciate this game and think it's worth the download, especially if you appreciate story.

Its preem Chooms

The game is so good


I luv it

Not typically into this type of game but, Im addicted.

brain chip make ur brainchip go brrrrrrr

Yes

Minus the charisma and impressive cock

fun game, keeps me entertained, although the capitalist hellscape setting feels a little too familiar. makes me a little sad. but it's got a surprisingly engaging plot with interesting twists and a great open world where i can wreak havoc, i like that

Play it now

W

really good.

PANAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

So far I'm intrigued how the games story, atmosphere, punk like future setting is also. The game play is a basic first person type of game but, with cybernetic enhancements/borderlands like leveling up system and Keanu reeves honestly sell's it for me as Johnny Silverhand

"Dirty Biz" is the best quest in the game, definitely watch the BD you definitely wont regret it, I promise.

love it

One of the best RPGs I've ever played. It's fun, witty, philosophical, whimsical, crude, sobering, somber, thought-provoking, optimistic, pessimistic, engaging, thrilling, fascinating and so much more. 
I already would recommend buying it and its DLC "Phantom Liberty" at full price. But if it's on sale, then it's simply a must-buy. 
Do not miss out on this masterpiece. 
The worries that plagued it at launch are long gone. Now, only greatness awaits you upon starting up this game.

So glad this game got a whole lot of love. Still a bit buggy from time to time (small rendering issues) but nothing major definitely love it. So much to do along with the DLC. CDPR definitely redeemed themselves on this one.

for sure worth the money, great game

its fun

The game play is very fun, though the story is kind of weak. It's worth playing, though I think it would be a while before I'd replay. I'd rate 7-8/10

i died so this game sucks

great game

I really like the genital customization.

new york simulator

very fun

pretty good game some bugs here and  there but all around enjoyable even after the launch it is still fun  9/10

Starts out good but gets repetitive and boring, really struggling just to finish it.

good

Buggier than 1.0 skyrim, even after 3 years of patches. Sometimes the game just crashes, sometimes you enter combat and can't pull out your gun, and the recommended fix is "go f*ck a prostitute". 

If this is emblematic of CD Projekt Red's quality standards, you also shouldn't buy The Witcher IV.

非常值得 但是还是有些bug没有修复 话事任务只要选择说服班尼特 阿吉拉尔的行为特征就无法关闭 读档也无法解决

wake the fuck up samurai.

good game

I bought this game for the first time in 2024. I can honestly say that this game is not only perfectly playable, but incredibly enjoyable. I mean, Keanu Reeves is in it so it's automatically perfect, a really good game is a bonus

muito bao

positive review.

starting to replay game and its still really buggy

good


peak

they made a game about the guy from fortnite

:(

ME and ALL my friends love CP! On EVERYONE'S soul CP is the best. Get it now.

One of the best games of all time

Just a better GTA. Replayability is not bad but for someone like me who plays for story, it isn't that great after you finish the final (long) mission. I have one problem though, why the fck did they remove the option to make Judy as the male MC's gf? Kinda disappointing tbh but it is what it is. 9/10

Despite a few quirks and quibbles, this game in its most complete and polished state qualifies for classic status. For me, its cool to play what is essentially an open world Deus Ex game. Sure, if you scratch away the surface level technical triumphs one can argue over how shallow the overall gameplay loop is, but I'm almost at 50 hours and still eager to explore this world. I'm hoping that if there is a sequel more options to interact with the environment and more ways to meaningfully spend money are added. As is, this game rocks.

CDPR is not pregnant but it delivers!
Witcher 3 in Cyberpunk world. Enough said.
Top-notch graphic, excellent music, diverse combat, engaging story and dialogue choices that actually make a difference. Every play through is a completely different experience.
Props to CDPR again. They had an unsatisfactory launch but they didn't give it up. They fine tuned this game to another masterpiece

Game obviously sucked on release, but if can forgive launch, and give it another chance, you will find a really damn good game. Props to CDPR for not abandoning this game. 

Witcher 4, lets go!!!!!

johnny silverhand

Fubn hamesa, get uahsdfu podcxifhrweofh. Many Thunbs up!

one of the best games i've ever played

A very mature but fun game, if you are over 18 and want to try an rpg in the same realm as the fallout games or elder scrolls I would highly recommend it. With a lot of freedom of choice with play styles and dialogue alike with past actions effecting future, if you like games like New Vegas or Morrowind I would very much recommend. The atmosphere, the characters and the focus to detail makes this one of the best Rpg fps games I've ever played.

Reminds me of the joy I felt playing the first two GTA games. Definitely room for improvement which I hope the developers feel inspired to keep working on.

Great game with a great story that allows you to choose your own path. overall a wonderful experience and would highly recommend.

10/10 would play again

gud

This game hits very HARD, like a punch towards your stomach, specially after the [spoiler]Suicide[/spoiler] ending: for sure one of my best favorite games.

Cyberpunk 2077 ist aufgebaut wie viele andere Openworld storygames unterscheidet sich aber von anderen Spielen mit seiner einzigartigen und spannenden storyline von vielen anderen Spielen. Durch die spannende Abwechslung zwischen  Haupt und Nebenstory wird ein abwechslungsreiches und geniesbares  Spielerlebnis geschaffen. Im großen ganzen ist Cyberpunk ein muss für alle storygame Genieser

“If i need your body il fuck it” Johnny Silverhand

So 4 years later after I initially absolutely disregarded the game because of very bad perfomance, now finally picking it up i really must say this game is a blast! The story is god-tier.

yes

I really love this game. The story is good, the characters are awesome, and the gameplay is really fun.

I have some nitpicks though. 

* Your responses in a conversation can swing so wildly in tone from one line to the next it's super weird-sounding

* Like with every game with dialogue options that are truncated, what your character actually says is sometimes not what you'd expect, and especially, the tone is wildly different than you'd expect, sometimes being way more accusatory than I wanted.

* This might just be me but it feels like Johnny is wishy-washy with what he wants sometimes. This is probably a result of the choices you can make, but he just swings wildly from seemingly being on your side to just hating you.

* Gameplay-wise, I find the UI to be more buggy than I remember it being when I played on release. Looting bodies is finnicky, with the UI not popping up all the time, the minimap said I was in combat once when I wasn't, and there was one time I got locked out of fast travel because the game glitched, and I had to restart the game. There were some other things that I can't remember now.

Overall, definitely worth it, especially on sale, and Phantom Liberty is absolutely worth picking up as well.

Best game i have ever played

I got David's jacket

Funnest game I own! Though as an amd user, even my 7900xtx struggles to get playable framerate at maximum graphics. Turn off path tracing. And you will be good to go!

love it

Honestly? The best game ever made. I know some have had bad experiences, and most especially when it first released. But this master piece is a perfect example of a comeback story. Give it a try, just fair warning, it'll raise your expectations forever.

I was hesitant to play this for a long time because of the bugs and issues on release. But CD Projekt Red really outdid themselves with this game. It is now one of my favourite RPGs. 10/10

It has cyberpsychos

Its Cyberpunk 2077, you like it or you dont. for all different reasons.

Best game OAT after Elden Ring

Hawk Tuah

10/10

this game is so peak its crazy ive always held this game near to my heart since its so good everything about this game is amazing 10/10

It's the guy from Fortnite

It's like GTA on steroids.

Pew pew, iz game, iz gud

def not optimized for pc but still a lot of fun

oh my got..

Peak.

Lemme just say this I have over 1k hours on Ps5 n still got the game on PC just to write a good review this is by far one the best games ever made as someone who played the day it released to see where it is now is awesome

GOOD

very cyberpunky wish i had it for longer to keep playing it

incredible story, visuals, environment, gameplay, replay value...

Game's preem, choom

mind numbingly boring. All the game is is people talking and talking in the most mundane and uninteresting way possible. I was falling asleep while playing despite trying everything in my power to stay invested in the story but I just couldn't.

Listen up chooms it time to chippin' in and fight the good fight against corporate greed, and get are lives back. This game is fucking nova especially with the new update and DLC to make game go nova.

Years after the premiere and the game is still clunky, the movement is awful. Can't recommend it, played 2 hours and had enough. The only good thing was the music.

wow

great game with captivating story and open world

this game will be a classic

This game is the type that replaces your reality with the story. Characters, story, Graphics, combat, and general feeling 10/10 in my opinion.

rizz

[] First time playing it properly, still haven't finished it, but I know i'll be putting more playthroughs after I finish it.

[] It has become my comfort game, and now that I got more invested in it, it kinda gave me the 'avatar depression syndrome'' kind of feeling inside (real thing btw), which to me, Is a very good thing, and it really shows how much I love it. 

[] The story is the main thing thing that I love at a game and this one succeeds in that. I love picking choices, and they really matter in this one.

[] The rest of what this game has to offer isn't something that bothers me, the gameplay is good, music is amazing, fashion and cars are awesome too. You can create a unique style that suits your taste considering the costumisation is wide in variety and I like that. 

[] I play games cuz' I love to play 'em, I don't pay much attention to the flaws of it, I'll leave that to the experts.

- ! - I highly recommend to buy it, whether it's on sale or not, it may still have bugs and issues here and there but they don't keep you from progressing forward, and besides, the dev's haven't abandoned it seeing patch 2.2 being out for a bit with some nice additions, so they'll probably fix more stuff in the future if it comes down as a necessity. - ! -

Have fun chooms, Night City is awaiting.


Once the cyberpunk veneer becomes mundane you realise you're just playing a GTA clone with the same boring GTA mission design and mundane side quests.  The story was interesting but there is too much doing nothing in between story beats in a world that is nothing more than a good tech demo for ray tracing.

Cyberpunk 2077 has become one of the best games ever made.  I just want more.

Played for 69 hours. Nice.

perfect

hot psychotic asian girl yippee

nice game, runs well on linux and steam deck, worth the high price tag. get it on sale if you can.

Visually stunning and immersive world - Love it.

Zajebista wciągająca gierka jeszcze bardziej kiedy masz dildo i napierdalasz nim ludzi 11/10

great game

I finished the game in 43 hours and explored all the endings—the storyline is on another level. The choices feel meaningful, and the gameplay (combat, driving, skills) offers unmatched versatility, rivaling GTA.

The mods are incredible (though I haven’t tried them yet), and the DLCs seem worth it—I’ll definitely be buying them. I hope they release a DLC that continues storylines like Johnny’s takeover and other unresolved arcs.

An amazing experience overall!

Story 10/10
combat 10/10
driving 9/10
NPC 8/10 (they rush to the road sometime when you driving close to them)


my only gripe with CyberPunk is I dont have a better system to run this masterpiece of a game on

Cyberpunk2077 may be the best story game I have ever played.
This game has everything:
- Incredible storyline and narrative
- Beautiful graphics, atmosphere and soundtrack 
- Complex and diverse combat/stealth system
There are so many difficult choices to make in a world that is dominated by technology, AI and mega corporations. This game really feels alive with its open world and all the interactions and characters. The Phantom Liberty DLC is also a very good expansion to the base game and lets you rethink the games decisions and their consequences even more. The main story endings really left me speechless.
I cannot wait for future games in this Cyberpunk universe and would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is into storytelling RPGs
10/10 - Masterpiece
<3

Best game ever I play it on the legion go and it is amazing I still play it on my regular setup and it is astonishing 


Yes

[i]I just want the world to know I was here. That I mattered. - V[/i]
[u]Pros:[/u]
+ Night City feels alive, with a rich atmosphere and stunning visuals
+ story swings between deeply engaging and somewhat naive/predictable, but it delivers closure and leaves a satisfying emotional impact
+ some sidequests are super good (like in Witcher 3)
+ deep customization options for character builds with cyberware, big firearm variety, melee is a bit boring
+ voice acting well made, especially Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves)
+ music is something in this game, from radio stations (Body Heat is my fav) to hits like "Fade Away"
+ I played on Hard difficulty and think it should be the default one, you are still too overpowered in the end
+ optimization is good; and got maybe one crash in 200h
+ The Phantom Liberty is a great DLC, and while the map area is smaller, it’s densely packed with content, great characters, and story
+ Edgerunners TV series is a must-watch after you play the game for a while. It enriches the world and vice versa — a perfect symbiosis.
[u]Cons:[/u]
- map is too big but not dense with activities; most police scanners and gigs look like typical Ubisoft filler stuff (DLC doesn’t have this problem)
- periodic inconsistent AI behavior can break immersion (car crashes, NPC frightened or acting weirdly)
- items like phones, tablets, and cigarettes sometimes bug in NPC hands
- rarely, loot stuck in dead enemies (reload helps)
- had a side quest bug that required a CDPR workaround to finish

Just got the devil ending its sad but it was really fun. Samurai build is the way to go, just dashing everywhere and slicing their heads off.

There are no words to describe this masterpiece

buy it, dont even think, just buy

still a little broken, driving cars is ASS hate it so much, AI is pretty dumb unless it a combat AI. police AI is also ass 

But over all game story and combat is fun

In its current state, it is the best game I've had the pleasure of playing. 10/10

GOATED

peak

:}

i love cyberpunk 2077

good game. if you are reading this, then buy the game.

brakes but in a kinda funny way

Johnny Is a BADDIE. He a Sigma. Trust

It's a great game, it's dope, worth it if you're into it


This game has an amazing story, gameplay, graphics, and value. I highly recommend you pick up and play this art. 

See ya, chooms!

there is no way to end a conversation

Love this game + phantom liberty is worth it

I wish I played when 1.0 was out, cuz I never met bad side of Cyberpunk.
It's first game since forever where I was reading everything, doing everything, in every possible way.
Also Anime is booster to play again and again / I recommend watching anime before playing game, playing game, watching anime again.
Right now it is my favourite game/universe ^^

What another awesome game from CD Projekt Red! I am pleased I waited for a year after the launch hype before playing it. The vast majority of initial bugs encountered has been fixed giving you a fantastic experience of a futuristic action RPG game as it was intended. The Phantom Liberty DLC is such an nice addition too. A story-rich game that's well worth your time!

very fun, banger

I enjoy it.

It's a cool game with a cool setting and a cool story

It's good.

Damn I have put a lot of time into this game. Of course it has it's issues but it is a good time.

gam e good


Actually I can`t imagine better game in such genre for now. Good action, better balance after 2.0

I tried so hard to like this game but I just couldn't. I Played it both at launch on console, and now with a PC that can run this game comfortably on max settings. I still encountered glitches here and there, and I still found the city and npcs to be pretty lifeless and dull. I didn't find combat particularly engaging or the story to be anything special. I know people have seemed to come around on this game and think it's good now, but for me it's still not a great experience, and I say this having played it at it's absolute worst, and at its absolute best.

Because if you don't play this, you're a gonk.

game good do play

yes

Main game 9/10. Add phantom libertly dlc 10/10

I like how you can transfer to the future with ez

I bought this game on launch and it was terrible (as everyone knows). But after hearing all the buzz I decided to try it out again, and I haven't been able to put it down.

gewwdd gewwmm

This is a horrendous game and everyone involved should be ashamed except the actors.
Holy COW!
where to begin...
Player agency: They simply dont believe in it. They have you wonderign around in these psuedo cutscenes and simply dont allow you to do ANYTHING they dont want the player to at that moment.
they dont respect the players time or agency, the world is lifeless and a very shiny visage. 

the driving:
this was, and i mean this, was programmed and conceived by children who never drove a car in their lives. the roads are a mishmash of lanes with no signage and random merges. its as if someone who watches driving but doesnt understand it attempted to simulate it. and it didnt work out well.


the dialogue is great.... stellar dialogue trees like:
Q: how did she pass?
A: oh, it was terrible, such and such happened and it was painful.
Q: ah thank you very much also she left something for me here to pick up, can i have it?
A: ah yeah she did. too bad what what happened to her but i guess you must have heard about it.

......

and no, this is not at some kind of home or care facility.

this is another aaa turd. only purchase if its on a HECK of a sale. 
50% or more.
oh and the bandaides the used to fix the friendly npc's in missions form getting stuck was:
we make they hover around and move in scripted area after the player has reached a certain spot.

really feels like an extremely over budget, cheaply made product





so good


One of the best FPS games I've played in my life honestly, don't think twice if it's on sale.

Very well thought out world and story, main story is way too short though.

cyperbunk 2077

aabsolute crap game

Rating: 9.5/10 (Masterpiece)

Cyberpunk 2077 has achieved one of the greatest redemption arcs in gaming history. It’s a stunning, immersive RPG that delivers on almost every level—but for me, it’s still missing that elusive something to make it a perfect 10.

What I Loved:

    Night City is Unmatched:
    Night City is the real star of the show. It’s vibrant, chaotic, and alive in a way few game worlds manage to achieve. From the neon-lit alleys of Japantown to the corporate opulence of City Center, every district is meticulously crafted. With improved AI, denser crowds, and enhanced environmental interactions since launch, the city finally feels like the bustling dystopia it was always meant to be.

    Deep, Immersive RPG Gameplay:
    Cyberpunk 2077 offers incredible freedom in how you approach the game. Whether you prefer hacking your way through systems, stealthily taking down enemies, or going in guns blazing, the gameplay accommodates multiple playstyles. The new updates and DLC bring even more depth to the combat and skill trees, making character builds more engaging than ever.

    Phantom Liberty DLC - A Game-Changer:
    The Phantom Liberty DLC is not just an expansion—it’s a revitalization. Set in Dogtown, a gritty new district of Night City, it introduces a tense spy-thriller storyline packed with twists, political intrigue, and moral dilemmas. Idris Elba’s performance as Solomon Reed is phenomenal, adding even more gravitas to the stellar voice acting. The DLC also brings significant improvements to the base game, like overhauled perk systems, vehicle combat, and more engaging side quests.

    Memorable Characters and Storytelling:
    Cyberpunk 2077’s story is rich and emotionally impactful. V and Johnny Silverhand (masterfully voiced by Keanu Reeves) have one of the most compelling dynamics I’ve seen in a game. The game masterfully weaves personal struggles with larger existential questions about identity and humanity. The Phantom Liberty storyline adds even more layers to this narrative brilliance.

    Technical Redemption:
    At launch, the game was plagued with bugs and performance issues, but it’s now in a state that lives up to its potential. CD Projekt Red has gone above and beyond to address the criticisms, making this one of the best post-launch redemption stories in gaming history.

What’s Still Missing:

    Lack of True Player Agency:
    As much as the game emphasizes choice, the main narrative often funnels you toward specific outcomes. While there are different endings, your decisions throughout the game don’t always feel as impactful as they could be.

    A Sense of Longevity:
    While the open world is packed with detail, it sometimes feels like a stage rather than a truly living world. Interactions with NPCs and side activities, though improved, still lack the depth to make Night City feel as reactive as it looks.

    Missing That "Perfect 10" Factor:
    For all its brilliance, the game still feels like it’s just short of perfection. Maybe it’s the lack of a revolutionary mechanic that changes the genre, or maybe it’s the way some gameplay elements (like crafting or economy systems) feel secondary. It’s hard to pinpoint, but there’s something intangible that stops it from being the definitive RPG experience.

Overall Thoughts:

Cyberpunk 2077 is no longer a cautionary tale—it’s a triumph. The Phantom Liberty DLC and continuous updates have elevated the game to masterpiece status, delivering one of the most immersive RPGs of this generation. The world-building, storytelling, and gameplay systems come together in a way that few games manage. However, as polished and engaging as it is, there’s still something missing—a spark or a layer of depth that could make it truly flawless.

Pros:

    Night City is a stunning, immersive open world.
    Deep, versatile gameplay with incredible build options.
    Masterful storytelling and memorable characters.
    Phantom Liberty adds an exceptional new storyline and gameplay features.
    A technical redemption that few games have pulled off.

Cons:

    Main narrative choices don’t always feel impactful.
    Some open-world interactions still feel surface-level.
    Missing an ineffable "wow" factor to make it a perfect 10.

Recommendation:
Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-play, especially in its current state. Whether you’re a fan of immersive worlds, gripping narratives, or deep RPG systems, it delivers on almost every front. The Phantom Liberty DLC is the cherry on top of an already incredible experience. It’s not just a game—it’s a world you’ll want to lose yourself in.

When it first came out, I finished it by watching it on youtube, then I finished the game on another account, but then the DLC came out and I finished it on this account, but I still didn't have it until today. It was a game I wanted to buy for years but I postponed it and now I have the game. One of the first things I'm looking forward to is modding it myself and taking lots of screenshots. CYBERPUNK BEST!

The writing... this setting lends to the most incredible satire. Get's a little too real. The writers have some serious socio economic awareness going on. There's a line Johnny says about a guitarist that we all get. "But the feeling - that's what counts. Guy's hurtin', got somethin he can't take. And it shows." Like, so difficult to describe in a little review. The characters are Thoughtful, they desire things, they have realizations and change, vulnerability. Panam referencing Jackie, who you told her about in passing, in a toast cause you toasted her homie Scorpion. The subtle ways characters talk to you when you're closer to them. Judy! Anyway, good shit, 10/10, I cried so many times.

Best game ever, but still has a lot of bugs. Latest update the cars and objects spawn upside down and tires blow up in the air. In the Delmaine mission with the cars in the garage i was upstairs and a car passed bellow me and i took damage...The braindances still don't work. I have had this game for 3 years, it's cool they are implementing new features, but they should also correct the ones promised that do not work. Those are minor issues though and as a developer myself i know how hard it is to get everything right. A master-piece of a game, really fun.

This game is dear to me. It's literally one of the most moving and atmospheric gaming experiences I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. This one will stick with me for years to come, especially the story of Phantom Liberty. It feels like a spy movie in all the best ways. 

If you want to get immersed in a story or if you can allow yourself to connect with good characters, don't skip on this one. You will not regret it.

Ohh and btw it looks beyond amazing to!

There's not a lot to say. It's a real masterpiece. I've completed all achievements, have seen all endings in both main game and DLC. And definitely will return back to once for sure. 20/10

[h1]Good morning, Night City![/h1]

Yesterday's body count lottery rounded out to a solid 'n' sturdy thirty! Ten outta Heywood - thanks to the unabated gang wars! One officer down, so I guess you are all [b][i]screwed[/i][/b]. 'Cause the NCPD will not let that go. Got another blackout in Santo Domingo. Netrunners are at it again, pokin' holes in the power grid. While over in Westbrook, Trauma Team's scrapin' cyberpsycho victims off the pavement. And in Pacifica... Well... Pacifica is still Pacifica.

This has been your man, Stan. Join me in another day in our [b][i]City of Dreams![/i][/b]

I've gone through the main story and Phantom Liberty, every time a story line or sub plot ends. I always end up asking myself, "Wait, that was it? There's nothing more?" The story isn't bad and it has it's memorable moments, unfortunately, it isn't enough in my opinion. The mechanics are not polished and the game is still very buggy. Melee combat feels horrible and enemies will land hits on you despite being, CD Project Red has also decided to go with the Bethesda path of difficulty. Making enemies bullet sponges that deal a lot of damage. Which doesn't go well with the fact that a lot of enemies can easily get in your face with how fast they are. I am a huge stealth enjoyer and it is horrible in 2077. Bad enemy pathing combined with shitty detection mechanics makes me feel like the worlds most garbage ninja. Skyrim is over a decade old and it does stealth better than this game. On the topic of Skyrim, Cyberpunk makes me want to play Skyrim. Unlike Cyberpunk, there is actually end game content for you to explore, you aren't forced to load a previous save because CDPR couldn't be bothered. The fact that people think this game was GOTY worthy over BG3 astounds me. I desperately want to love this game, it has an amazing foundation, but the rest of the structure is rotten. CDPR dropped the ball on this game, any enthusiasm I had for any of their future titles is gone and my faith in them as a company is dead.

-recommend-

Cyberpunk has a very special place in my library as one of my favorite games. The world and the story are captivating. Despite the rocky release, they put a lot of little details and effort into this game that others lack. Everywhere you look there is something to see. I find the gameplay really fun and interesting (tho it doesnt run for shit on my pc anymore). THE FIRST THING IM PLAYING AND PART OF THE REASON IM UPGRADING MY PC IS CYBERPUNK. 

That said, I do have some critiques. BUT IDK too controversial for a steam review byeee! 

I look forward to more of this game and completing the dlc :) recommended!~

Interesting main story and side quests? check
Regular updates makes the game better? check
Burn corposhit!? check

[b]I started by Cyberpunk journey around a year ago during 2.0 launch on PS5, spent 350 hours there, then another 150 hours on GOG when I built a new PC and then I was gonna give myself a break from this game, to play something else maybe....then 2.2 dropped and here I go again buy the game on steam lol.[/b]

[h3]So how does this game pull me back in so easily from time and time again?[/h3]

The MOST FUN gameplay loop in recent memory from any game truly. You really can just about think of any way to play and the game supports it, then allows you go crazy with it unleashing your ultimate power fantasy. Usually most games become boring when you become OP, however in Cyberpunk the more OP you are - the more fun and crazy the game becomes. [b]V is on his/her way to becoming a Legend of Night City and You as the player really feel that way.[/b]

Hard not to mention the AMAZING Phantom Liberty which is in many ways better than the base game for me personally. Dogtown feels so different and truly dangerous out of any district, so layered and vertical packed with so much exploration and amazing loot. Fantastic story, side gigs with meaning and freaking Idris Elba who absolutely crushed his role. This expansion has a more killer Bond soundtrack than any Bond movies in 15+ years which is wild.

Cyberpunk 2077 has cemented itself into my top 3 videogames of all time, the "fun factor" of this game is off the charts and a shining mod support just keeps pulling me back in.



4070 ti has the ray tracing just blowing my mind. I'm glad I waited for all the updates and patches. The game runs like a dream and is a ton of fun to play...

Good game.  Not what was promised though.
I have not forgotten the promise of an actual RPG with different story lines.  Deadset lies.
It's essentially a futuristic GTA with more (redundant) side missions.  And no third person.

I've been playing this game since DAY 1 and I remember having a good time playing it and liking the story. I beat the games and played the DLC Phantom Liberty then moved on.

Recently, I retired my 70hr V male character for good and decided to do another playthrough with a female V now being a 100% more focused on the narrative alongside with the benefits of replaying it with all of the optimizations and updates that the game received years later.

In my initial play through, I would give it a 7/10.

Now, I'm giving it a 10/10.

The city is beautiful and it can get immersive sometimes. I love the in-game ads in the game and I just love the RPG elements in it. V and the characters around them are great characters. These are 10x the amount of detail on said characters (backstory, dialogue, character design, motivations) compared to Starfield's mediocre characters.

Should you buy it? Yes and I recommend the DLC too.

Cant even critique the game properly as CD project even after all the years since release was unable to provide a playable experience for visualy impaired, text size settings does nothing and windows magnifier is locked to the middle of the screen.

Got it on Xbox series X before and it was great, BUT PC IS THE WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!! ITS FILLED WITH DYSTOPIAN BACKSTABBING VIOLENT GOOOOODNESSSSS!!!!!

flawed game but story the endings and some of the characters are quite good , setting and world are pretty cool too

A good exploration of one of my favourite fictional settings. Good balance, excellent plot and beautiful looking.

Great Game , very imersive universe , the only bad part is the lost potential and refinement upon launch , other than that amazing game

bought for steam deck. works but doesn't seem very efficient.  fan is working hard and game just gives up when the going gets rough.  great game, clunky on the steam deck

It's been 4 years since cyberpunk came out, game sits at a comfortable very positive rating. People that initially said it was good on release because of buyers remorse are now calling it one of the greatest games ever made because they like the spin-off show.

Objectively ? The game is still mediocre at best. Not as satisfying to play as GTA5 that is 11 years old now. Driving still feels like you're in an empty box, touch one pebble and see yourself flying. Enemies are still spongy bullet magnets that never die and every fire fight feels like it takes tens of minutes. Stealth just simply doesn't work. Getting spotted by an enemy means every single enemy within the entire fucking building is immediately on alert and attacking you. Some perks just flat out don't work at all, and some don't work some or in the worsy cases most of the time (i.e: multi hacking on enemies via netrunner, or getting out of combat by leaving enemy line of sight). Snipers can shoot you through cover. Most walls are not high enough to hide behind even while crouched (expert merc can't lower his head below cover).

Subjectively the story is a passive aggressive attack on video game power fantasy. You play this rpg game where you make your own character with the purpose of getting to an ending where you turn into another, "better" character. Most endings are dogshit and miserable, can't get out of the old cyberpunk genre cliche of "sometimes you just don't win". The endings that aren't just outright the worst possible outcome are at best lukewarm platitudes where you accept a compromise that is still inferior to killing yourself. Your choices don't matter until the absolute very end, but that just reflects on how much this game hates you for having fun with it. Pair all this with the cringe ass slang that's present in every single one of the lines of dialogue and garbage original ideas like forced BD's, net sections, playing from other character's perspectives and other means to waste your time by taking control away from you (in an RPG). This, like "games" such as Uncharted, should have been a movie, tho unlike uncharted this would have also been a shit movie.

What about the DLC ? Same shit, but just that little bit worse. Story has the exact same DNA, where you can't really trust anybody, so all the (1) decision that you make at the very end is completely random with no way to tell what you're actually picking. Same convoluted plot. Same disgusting outcome as your reward for going though the hell that is the forced combat sections and boss fights. No, seriously! You HAVE to fight bosses. If you're stealth focused, or a netrunner, you're shit out of luck because you go into combat immediately and hacks do jack shit. You either have to take the difficulty down, or slog through it for 30-40 minutes by hitting barely visible sweet spots for 3 damage with a weapon that hopefully you brought even though you had no intention to use it and have no perks for.

All in all, is cyberpunk all bad ? Not really. There's definitely great character interactions. There's some really good side missions. Johnny Silverhand is a pretty good companion even though his character completely ruins all immersion. Are all these things worth playing the game tho ? A definitive no.

TLDR, Cyberpunk, just like other "Cinematic™" "video games" like uncharted and tlou, is barely worth calling a video game and them, calling it an RPG, is akin to false advertising. it runs well now after 4 years of tinkering (tho i am running it on a 4090), but the gameplay has barely been fixed to the point of being an inferior GTA clone. The story is dogshit, with a few memorable moments sprinkled in, that culminates in 1 of around 8 miserable outcomes that will leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth. And the hype surrounding it, even now, 4 years later, is nothing more than a combination of buyers remorse from back then and fleeting love for a mediocre show now. Don't waste your time, play Witcher 3 instead.



The true Labour of Love. 
57 hours in and still so many customizations to discover. The possibilities are endless you can become stealthy netrunner, guns blazin doomslayer, or a katana wielding samurai (katana can block bullets!!!). if i were to list down the customisations to cars, clothes, apartments it will prolly take an entire day. Not to mention the different gangs, the braindances, the cyberpsychoes, the chance encounters, the INSANE PHOTO MODE 

Excellent 11/10 game, once you start playing you will never be able to stop, and i mean NEVER, there's too much to discover in night city

cyber the punks in the cyber game where you are the punk with cyber so you can become the punk of cyber or THE cyberpunk 10/10 would play again

its up there in the best role playing games of all time. 90 hours in and the game keeps getting better. never drags, combat is fun, choices matter, side missions are interesting, the world is alive and deep and most importantly the characters are so well written. amazing truly a work of art

After riding the initial hype train to disappointment station, I had to shelve Cyberpunk 2077 due to its infamous launch-day issues. Like many others, the game was practically unplayable for me regardless of graphics settings. Fast forward a couple years and several major patches later, and I can confidently say: Night City was worth the wait.
CD Projekt Red has transformed this into the game we were promised. The dystopian metropolis they've created isn't just visually striking – it's uncomfortable in all the right ways. Every corner of Night City serves as a dark mirror, reflecting the potential extremes of corporate dominance and human degradation. The omnipresent violence isn't gratuitous; it feels like a natural extension of this world's brutal reality.
The gameplay shines through its versatility. Whether you prefer going in guns blazing or ghosting through missions, the game accommodates your style meaningfully. The hacking mechanics remain engaging throughout, and different character builds feel genuinely distinct rather than just statistical variations. Even after hours of play, I found myself discovering new approaches to challenges.
The narrative stands as one of my favorite gaming stories, weaving personal stakes with larger themes in a way that kept me invested throughout. While the driving mechanics could use some fine-tuning, it's a minor gripe in what has become an exceptional experience.
If you, like me, were burned at launch but have been waiting for the right time to jump in – that time is now. Cyberpunk 2077 has evolved into a unique and compelling experience that's absolutely worth your time investment.
Shoutout to Edgerunners as it got me back into the game!
[Recommended]

honestly a really good game, had a bad start but the dev team has definitely redeemed themselves. game still has some funny visual bugs (misplaced items, floating cars, wacky characters, etc) but overall is a good and fun game. worth every penny

i played the base game and bought the DLC and i must say i love it althought there is some bug but it little to no problem and also you can mod the game however you like which make the game more better than ever 10/10

Truly the best ARPG I have ever played. The story, the city, the characters..... I wanna cry

Just play it. If you like the Cyberpunk aesthetic just play it and I highly recommend to do any and all side quests. Over 100 hours in this game and I don't need feel like a single hour was wasted. It got me so emotional. ESPECIALLY the DLC. Phantom Liberty was just on another level and honestly it could have been a whole separate game of it's own, it was better than the base game IMO. Music, sound design, art design, building design, car design, clothing design literally all of it all believable and the city my god the city is so fucking immersive. Grab it on sale if you're on the fence but whatever bad shit you heard about the game before you can leave that in the past. Recent patches have made the game the most optimized it's ever been and if you're into virtual photography you're going to absolutely ADORE the hell out of photo mode in this. PLAY IT!

Willing to replay this game and buy the dlc for the PC edition. Because this game is so good... it should have been nominated for goty 2021, but yes there are a lot of annoying bugs in low and mid specs when this game was launched.

Woah, where do I begin? Cyberpunk 2077 is an interesting one for me, as I’ve tried to start it multiple times, but my computer was never good enough to run it. On the occasion when I upgraded, I thought I was done trying the game for what would have been the fourth time—boy, am I glad I didn’t follow through with that!

Cyberpunk is a game that is ridiculously ambitious, as much as it is flawed in many elements. That said, it honestly provides one of, if not the best, deep and immersive sci-fi RPG experiences out there. Nowhere else will you find a place like Night City. The sheer size and liveliness of it all is so gripping that you'll often find yourself just driving around to enjoy the views.

I don’t want to spoil anything, so I won’t speak too much on specifics, but the story and side missions are fantastic and showcase the quality of what CD Projekt Red can produce. Phantom Liberty further enhanced this experience and really showcased what a great setting this is. I could go on and on about the expansion, but I’ll keep it short and just say it’s utterly fantastic.

Playing this makes me insanely excited for The Witcher 4 and what they’ll come out with, but I do hope they’ve learned their lesson and will delay the game's release if necessary. While Cyberpunk 2077, for me, is a solid 9/10, had they not come back and fixed the game—bugs and all—it would’ve completely soured the experience, and I’m sure that has deterred many people from even trying the game. Even so, I do have faith that they’ll do right by what they’ve learned, and with that, please play the game and enjoy it!

This game is awesome, imo the best single player rpg you can play right now.
There are tons of different ways to change your skills and with that your playstyle.
There are plenty of meaningfull choices in dialogue that actually affect how you proceed through the story/quest.
Runs smooth as butter, looks amazing, and it's just an allround fun and immersive experience.
Phantom liberty is also a great addition to the game, definitly worth getting if you wanna get the most out of your time in Night City.
So what are you waiting for choom? Go and make something of yourself in our city of dreams!

I pre-ordered the game back in 2020 because I thought: "Hey its CDPR. Not possible that they mess this up." Boy was I wrong. The launch was 'rocky' to say the least.

I thought that that was it: "How do they come back from this? This game is done for." Well, I am extremely happy to say that I was wrong again.

As I sit here with Phantom Liberty's credits rolling before me, I felt a familiar void. The kind that I felt when I finished Witcher 3 and have fallen hopelessly in love with the story, game, characters and Night City. CP2077 in its current state is a definite RPG masterpiece with the highest of highs I have ever experienced in my 25+ years of gaming.

I am now thinking: "How do they top this with Witcher 4? Impossible!" Would love to be proved wrong again for the 3rd time.

Was munching down on a chicky sandy when Sliverhandy tried to touch me with is rock hard band boy guitar. Would recommend.

I tend to spent more time customizing my character than I did making real-life decisions the last weeks. Its one of the best single-player story games I’ve ever played, and it hooked me from the first second. The choices you make are impactful and add depth to the story, making decision feel meaningful. The Phantom Liberty DLC is absolutely worth buying, taking the experience to another level. If you haven’t played it yet, you’re missing out.

Best game OAT. dont listen to the bs that other people yap about when they say this game is "bad bc of the launch" its not the launch anymore is it? hell no, its 2.2 and been out for almost 5 years now, problems been solved go play it when its on sale or sum idfk

This game is truly magnificent. The story is really special and immersive, it gets me hooked every time I play this. Truly a comeback from all games that this has become one of my favorite games that I have ever played.

watson is great
Dogtown is great
40 hours of grind to for level cup is meh
lacks optimization and not enough hoes in town.
I see my future in this game


great game but horrible for you mental health if you want to live good and dont get anxiety i highly recommend not playing it but if you are like me and dont want to live no more try it for your self but all that aside 10/10 story 10/10 graphic 10/10 mechanics

So a little backstory. I got cyberpunk in 2020. The day it was released. I hated it. 2 hours in the character creator  and  the game crashes. A little annoying but I proceed on. I then get further into the game. (Meet hanako at embers , iykyk) the game crashes again. Not to mention the game crashed every mission upon release , again very mildly annoying, but I manage. I get to the  embers quest , the game crashes again , and all of my data is lost. granted , I was on console on the time , but it completely put me off of the game for years. I decided to come back to the game 4 years later (with the encouragement of a friend) and I’m in absolute awe. The gameplay is amazing (a few bugs here and there) but nothing game breaking. Cyberpunk is truly worth playing and experience. The assets (ahem PANAM PALMER) the missions , the side missions are very entertaining. I was reluctant to return to the game , but I’m more than happy I came back. Please please please don’t be like me and wait years to come back to the game.  Play the game !!

The game released in a rough state but CD Project Red really made a comeback with this one! Huge fan of Cyberpunk 2077 and really enjoying my playthrough. What an amazing storyline!

I feel like a jock in an 80s movie who started dating the nerdy girl as a prank and then fell madly in love with her

never played on initial release, game is clean, outstanding graphics, solid controls, the city is alive, free to do whatever you want. great action adventure game.

Cyberpunk 2077 may not be my favorite RPG, but it's an undeniably impressive one, and one I greatly enjoyed my time with. I can't comment too much on the action and gameplay aspects because I'm really bad at it and blundered my way through on the easiest difficulty without making use of pretty much any of the cybernetic enhancements and upgrade trees, but I can say I had fun with the game and it's clear that there's a lot here for you to sink your teeth into if you enjoy first-person shooters. What really made me fall in love with this game was its presentation and writing. Night City is like no other video game world, so massive and messy and convoluted that you'll never learn the whole of it, and driving through its streets past the countless neon signs and towering skyscrapers is the most immersive experience I've ever had in a video game. This beautiful city serves as the stage for some of the best writing video games have to offer. While the main story is quite impressive in its own right, what really caught my attention were the numerous side quests full of complex characters and difficult choices. I really felt like I came to know some of these characters during my time in Night City, and when I left I felt as though I had made my mark on the world around me. It's these important side quests that I believe are the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 because they feel much more intimate and human than a lot of the main story, which sometimes tries too hard to be cool and 'cyberpunky' while losing sight of the human tale underneath. Still, when paired with the fantastic side quests, the narrative is ultimately what left a lasting impression on me. Cyberpunk 2077 may have launched as a broken and incomplete garbage fire, but through the developers' constant hard work, it has transformed into an undeniable masterpiece of modern game design, mixing finely-tuned gameplay with writing that will rip your heart out of your chest and wrapping it up in some of the most impressive art and graphics that gaming has to offer. For anyone with a love for strong writing, meaningful choices, and immersive gameplay, I think Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-buy game.

[b]Rating:[/b] ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

After spending 125 hours in Night City, I can confidently say: this game is an absolute masterpiece. It’s gritty, gorgeous, and full of life (and a fair bit of death). Cyberpunk 2077 takes immersion and storytelling to the next level, offering an experience that lingers in your thoughts long after you’ve powered down.

[h2]Gameplay - A Futuristic Playground[/h2]
Cyberpunk 2077 is what happens when an RPG meets a chaotic sandbox. Whether I’m hacking into enemies’ brains, blasting my way through gangs, or stealthily sneaking past guards, the game gives me endless ways to approach every scenario.
The progression system is deeply satisfying, letting you truly shape your version of V. My build? A deadly mix of quickhacks and sharpshooting that feels both strategic and overpowered in the best way possible.

[h2]Worldbuilding - A City That Breathes[/h2]
Night City is unlike any other game world I’ve experienced. It’s alive, pulsing with neon lights, shady characters, and hidden stories. Walking through its streets feels like stepping into a sci-fi novel, where every corner holds a secret or an encounter.

The attention to detail is mind-blowing—from the grime in back alleys to the gleaming skyscrapers in Corpo Plaza. It’s a city of contrasts, and I can’t help but get lost in its beauty and chaos.

[h2]Story - Deep and Personal[/h2]
The main storyline is gripping, with emotional highs and lows that left me speechless. The side quests, though, are where the game truly shines. These aren’t filler—they’re intricate, meaningful stories that expand on Night City’s lore and its inhabitants.

Every choice feels impactful, and the game doesn’t shy away from moral ambiguity. It’s not about doing the “right thing”—it’s about surviving in a world that doesn’t care about you.

[h2]Highlights - What Makes It Stand Out[/h2]

Deep, complex characters that feel human.
A visually stunning world that’s as immersive as it is massive.
Customization options that let you truly make V your own.
Endless replayability, thanks to the branching storylines and builds.
[hr][/hr]

[h2]Cons - The Shadows in the Neon[/h2]

The AI can feel a little predictable in certain encounters.
Some features, like the open-world police system, feel underdeveloped.

[h2]Final Thoughts - A Modern Sci-Fi Masterpiece[/h2]
Cyberpunk 2077 is ambitious, daring, and unforgettable. After 125 hours, I’m still finding new things to love about this game. Night City has a way of pulling you in and refusing to let go.

If you’re a fan of immersive worlds, compelling narratives, and the freedom to carve your own path, Cyberpunk 2077 is an absolute must-play.

I wanted to give it a shot after hearing about the improvements and bug fixes online. If this is what people consider "good" I can't imagine how bad it was when it released.
The game is all about looking good, the game play is mid, NPC are uncanny, car handling is painful as driving on ice.
I regret buying this game.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible experience, offering diverse character builds that keep gameplay fresh and engaging. The rich dialogue and captivating story make it one of the best narrative-driven games out there. Visually, it’s stunning, with graphics that bring Night City to life in breathtaking detail. While the game excels in many areas, it could benefit from deeper choice-and-consequence mechanics to enhance player agency. That said, it’s a minor flaw in an otherwise phenomenal game. Whether you're a fan of action, RPGs, or immersive storytelling, CP 2077 delivers an unforgettable journey. Highly recommended!

For me, this is the best game I've ever played in my life. The characters experience an incredible development within the game, especially at the end. I'm not really someone who is built close to the water, but the ending with “Songbird” completely tore my heart out. This game here is a masterpiece and I am incredibly grateful that the developers have released such a game. I will miss Jacky, Panam, Judy, V, Misty and even Reed. I can't even list them all because they're all great.

The best ending in this game? The one with Panam & Song Mi. 

Thank you so much for the absolute emotional chaos at the ending with Songbird.

this Game started out really rough but over time has been molded into what i think is the perfect single player story game, this game hits every emotion for me. 10/10 would goon again

The greatest open world ever created, Night city is absolutely incredible & packed full of detail. 
I just finished the main game and DLC for the first time and jumped straight into a new game straight after, that's how freaking good this game really is.

This game definitely deserves it's spot to your Library. One of the games that question you and rewards you depending on choices you make. The game is the first most cinematic game I have played in first person view. This is a masterpiece and I would gladly play the next CDproject Red Games in near future :) 10/10

10/10 there is a npc voice line from one of the gangs that says "im gonna go mega evil on your ass" 
Kept playing long after I 100%ed just cause of how diverse the combinations between cyberware and skill trees are. If your pc is powerful enough to run it I couldnt recommend this game enough. Oh and also tons of mods available. 

What are you still reading this for go buy the game already!

Generally beautifully done graphics with amazing soundtracks, character interactions, and gameplay mechanics. Lots of freedom to choose how you wish to play be it for story paths, micro details in character creation, or general combat gameplay with a wide variety of combinations available from skill trees, to cyberware, to weapon types, etc etc. Story paths for each ending are incredibly well written, and the DLC integrates into the main game seamlessly with a tear-jerking storyline of its own. Overall might be the best AAA game I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

As someone who has explored every inch of this map and played it through more than 30 times i may sound bias when i say this game is fantastic. regardless of the rocky launch and the bugs it released with, CD project red has truly set the bar for what single player story mode rpgs should be.

This is to anyone who was discouraged from playing the game due to its abhorrent launch. They fixed it and are slowly adding even more things to it. The game is very playable, enjoyable and mostly bug-free (currently no major game-breaking issues to my knowledge).

The gameplay is entertaining, the story is good, the characters and world/environment are peak (with a few exceptions).

All in all very good, definitely would recommend to anyone who likes sci-fi and action RPGs.

The variety and quality of the story and the builds you can choose in this game is insane, the relationships can take very different paths but everything fits perfectly no matter what you choose. And when you pair all this depth with an equally responsive and beautiful world, you get something better than the lie they once sold.

edit: CD Projekt Red said they weren't updating the game any further when 2.0 launched, we're already at 2.2 and it's past amazing.

Forget how this game launched. This is a top 5 game for me after completing almost everything there is to do.
The story is a real rollercoaster, the city is amazing and fun to explore, the companions are great and unforgettable.
The freedom to do as you wish after completing the prologue is great. No secret borders or minimum level quests, the DLC is just as accessable, and you have a TON of ways to build your character the way you want.

You know when you finish a good book or TV series, or you lose someone close to you? That emptiness inside that you cannot replace, and the only thing you'd wish is to go back in time and experience it like the first time again? Yeah?

Play this game. You will have zero regrets. Especially if you like open worlds and/or RPGs. I'll miss you Panam

This game is my GOAT. From the setting to the characters, quests and in game world, I haven't found anything as capturing since playing this game. I highly reccommend doing most or all side quests, as those are what makes the game world into what it is, not to mention the effects on the ending of the main story. It has some flaws, I wish it did some things different and my god I want a new game plus mode, but if you give the game a honest shot, I find it hard to believe that you will be disappointed. At the time I have a RTX 3080, but I cannot wait to revisit the game with a top end GPU and witness all its glory.

story is one of the most interactive stories I'v played to date. truly almost a masterpiece. cant not recommend.

I waited a long time to play this game... it's a very great game, DLC rocks, just got an update... ton of fun.

The ending of the dlc was amazing. No spoilers. But i had the bad ending and well i would recommend it to people it was just so detailed and good and really hit me in the feels. Got the Swords ending. So much dialogue for a bad ending is amazing.

The rest of the game was amazing too of course but the dlc was the cream on top.

Storyline? Excellent
Writing? Top-notch
Graphics? A PC ray-tracing showcase
Great Characters? Uh how 'bout almost all of them?

I like to think that Cyberpunk 2077 became one of the greatest comeback stories in gaming second only to No Man's Sky. Between Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba, I don't know what more to say to sell you.

I'm one of the few who enjoyed this game on release day, playing on a PS4. Back then I enjoyed it and could tell with enough tender love and care it could become one of the greatest games ever. In the years since its tumultuous launch, it's not just been patched and become a stable, working game, but it's been upgraded and expanded upon through multiple QOL features but also the best DLC I've ever experienced: Phantom Liberty.

The first person POV immerses you into one of the the most detailed cities in gaming and the seamless dialogue only enhances the immersion. The strongest RPG elements lie in the combat and cyberware as you decide what kind of build you want V to have. Everything in this game in seamless and you'll quickly find yourself falling in love with the sights and sounds of Night City. If you're on the fence about buying the game, don't be. It is stable, beautiful, finished and is still receiving updates adding small things here and there to enhance the player experience. 
10/10

3/5 - Mid 

Shooting is basic, not terrible but nothing special either. The enemy AI is basically non-existent. The world is NOT immersive at all. NPCs will not react to anything other than violence, and they don't even have simulated routines. The named NPCs are uninteresting. The cars are floaty and unresponsive, meaning they are not fun to drive. I didn't run into any glitches or game breaking bugs though, so the game is technically working fine, so I gave it a 3/5 for being a working game.

Apparently, there are mods to make the game more immersive, but the latest update broke them.

This game has become what was promised initially, and maybe even better as they keep adding new updates. The graphics and gameplay are super clean. The story is solid as well but is very dialogue heavy at times. Night city is probably the best part with something around every corner and always feeling alive. 10/10

sorry but i've always been a cyberpunk fan...even in the buggy beginning

very Preem game choom, dont be a gonk and buy it, its worth your eddies.
You better not klep it either.

The game is absolutely stunning with ray tracing but as soon as you notice NPC behaviour the immersion is gone.

I only bought the game after version 2.1.
I prefer the fantasy medieval like Witcher games, but still it is a fantastic game in the current state.

Witcher 3 is a 10/10 for me. This is a 9/10 after 2.1 version.

What I liked:
- Big map
- Lots of things to do
- Fast & fun combat
- Both main and side missions have good story

I waited for the initial bugs to get fixed before buying. Great game with expansive content, however, still a tiny bit buggy. Had some loading issues and minor crashes but overall very satisfied


Writing this review in December 2024, I first played this back in 2020 when it released, the game was unbearable, poor optimization, lots of bugs and unfinished business, now 4 years later i am revisiting this game, and i can easily say CDPR did a good job reviving this masterpiece of a game, the story is perfect and fluid, the game feels more smooth, things are fixed and i have a lot of good time playing this now, perfect example of a positive comeback, Cyberpunk 2077 goes down as one of the best games in history now, even it had a pathetic launch, even though i was able to finish the game 4 years ago, revisiting this game, feels so fresh and lovely, the soundtrack is just breeze to the ears, Keanu's acting and performance is top notch, overall a lovely game.
Also,
See you in the Major leagues Jackie 🥺🥺🥺

This game gives me hella motion sickness even after adjusting all the relevant settings. Swaying cameras during conversations or cutscenes. And the constant flashing of EVERYTHING just to give a futuristic vibe. Can’t play it past 10 minutes at a time without feeling like absolute shit

This game is my second life. I currently live in the area that was the inspiration for the cyberpunk world. So its the only game that looks very realistic to me. Well, when I lived in Russia, it was Fallout games that were the most realistic haha. If you ever want to feel like you're dwelling in Night City, visit Hong Kong.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game I played in one breath, fully immersing myself in its world. The neon-lit streets of Night City pulse with life, while the gripping story and complex characters keep you hooked. With deep customization and thrilling gameplay, it’s a must-play for RPG fans seeking a futuristic adventure.

Cyberpunk 2077 is legitimately one of my favorite games of all time and the Phantom Liberty expansion and recent patches have only made it better.

And now with the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 you can pretend instead of Johnny Silverhand being in your mind it's Shadow the Hedgehog!

...there's probably a mod for that isn't there?

An incredible experience that you can replay over and over without ever getting bored.

Admittedly, it took me a while to get around to playing Cyberpunk when I first played it on PS5 but I was blown away. Buying it again on PC was an impulse decision but I don't regret it because with the modding capabilities this game has, I genuinely believe you will NEVER get bored.

10/10
