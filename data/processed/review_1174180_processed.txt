I ain't gay or nothin but this horsey game is pretty cool

fun game got it when it was on sale very fun worth it

It's RDR2. I guess that's more than enough to say about this game.

drank 9 beers killed 2 women, burned the corpses and died by crashing into a fence


arthur dies ftw

goat.

The most beautiful and immersive game out there.

Needs rockstar account / launcher 
No offline mode

good and fun good game
i recomend to play

very fun game, long storyline. hardly through it at all

nig

Amazing Story rich game. If someone likes RPGs, its one of the best.

Fucking rockstar games launcher is required. Dont buy it

This game is good but not in 2024

Amazing first few scripted hours. Loved that. Then you arive to some camp and game tells you... Go and do whatever you want, ride on the horse everywhere, so it takes ages etc. If you like sandbox and atmospehere more than playing, enjoy. I got bored very fast. Rockstar games are just not for me. I find this even more boring than GTA V and trust me, that says something.

fun story

Life is full of pain but there is also love and beauty.

love it it lit

Why is vandalisim a valid reason for cops to open fire on me

Old America is just awesome. Perfect story and gameplay

GOAT

Hope i can play a game like this in future again 💕

wowo

Very good story game. I recommend.

The Best Game Ever

Its very fascinating game..........

tuff


the best

I know this is an amazing game. If I could play it I may agree with that.

But I can't, because it seems this era of game design completely forgets to allow for lower specced machines to run their software. I've spent 12 hours according to steam running the benchmark and crashing out.

Mouthwashing is 500mb and runs amazingly.

I'm on an RX580 with a Ryzen 7 cpu, getting old but should be able to run this - and it does, reliably, with no frame drop. Until it crashes. I'm tired of trying to fix this. I'll update this review when I finally get a new card.

At least with older games I could accept low frame rates, blurry, pixelly graphics that are barely legible, but I could make that choice and run the game. This era of graphics is awful, I would happily accept no fancy lighting effects whatsoever if it meant I could run the game.

mantop bossku!!!

Pretty good game, I've already finished it 4 times on my Xbox, I only bought it on PC for the insane graphics. Highly recommend the story, one of the best in all of gaming history in my opinion. Online kinda sucks if you're alone, but if you have friends it's pretty enjoyable. Not a big fan of gold bars but overall, definitely buy this masterpiece.

please make this game ps5 controller supportive

不见得所有好游戏都适合所有人。恼人就是这款游戏的体验，繁琐的操作，没有快速存档，还有更加烦人的自动存档提示让体验大打折扣。

I've actually finished the game before on a downloaded copy. It was so dang good, I had to buy here so I could replay + have my achievements on as well. BEST game ever, whether it's story, open world, random things, all of it!

Best game ever in my opinion.Every gamer should have played this once in their life

Cowboy hats off. One of them games you should complete at least once within your lifetime. 
it starts really slow, but once the story picks-up, it's addicting to know what will happen next.
Great writing. Been a while since i got hooked and attached to the story, characters, places, (and even horses.) that this game made me shed a tear more compared to any other media for as long as i can remember. It's really good.

goooodddddddddd

This is just walking simulator and horse riding simulator but the music of the game is really beautiful

zAa

cvhujowe

amazing game

great game i mean absolutely amazing in almost every aspect

Awesome western, pre 1900 story mode!

hmmnggg.... cowboy

BEST GAME EVR

It's a lot like playing a good book.

its the best story game i ever played

A true masterpiece in every sense of the word

It's a very fun game, I met people wearing white dresses and a white headcone standing next to a burning cross and they gave me money 🤑🤑🤑

LOVE

herr morgan ist sehr gut

I would give a heroin addicted homeless the best oral sex for this game.

Will change your view on life

By my estimation, this is the best game of all time. I don't make that statement lightly, either. That being said, it will forever be one of the biggest travesties in gaming history that this game has been completely abandoned by R*, for all intents and purposes. As utterly excellent as it is, there's a mountain of potential for DLC. But nope, R* can't be bothered to expand on its excellence.

Poker

good game with good story and gameplay

SOOOOOOO FUCKING GOOD

my favorite game

😍

Great open world

Actually a perfect story

No

Still the best game i played till now leaving behind a hole in my heart i hope rdr 3 will fill. Arthur 💖

perfect game

best game ive ever played frfr

Game itself is one of the best ever. Rockstar just need to remove the abomination that is the sign in launcher, I just want to open the game and play it. Why are developers deliberately going out of their way to piss off their own consumers with garbarge ideas like this.

"CINEMA"

GAME SO GOOD

**Red Dead Online: A Timeless, Immersive Experience Beyond GTA Online**

Red Dead Online offers a stunning and immersive world that sets it apart from its more modern, chaotic counterpart, GTA Online. While both games excel at open-world adventures, it’s Red Dead Online’s unique charm, atmosphere, and sense of adventure that make it shine as a standout experience.

At its core, Red Dead Online offers players the chance to live in a meticulously crafted Wild West. The sprawling landscapes, from snow-capped mountains to vast plains dotted with wild animals, make every journey feel like a true exploration. Whether you're galloping on horseback across a golden sunset or hunting in the dense forests, the sense of immersion is unmatched. The environment itself feels like a living, breathing entity, where nature and humanity coexist in ways that feel organic. In GTA Online, the urban sprawl and high-speed chases can become monotonous, but Red Dead Online’s world offers endless moments of peaceful solitude or high-stakes excitement in equal measure.

One of the most powerful aspects of Red Dead Online is its slower pace, which allows players to appreciate the finer details. It’s not all about high-octane action; there’s room for crafting, fishing, hunting, and living off the land. This slower, more deliberate approach allows for storytelling and moments of calm—something that often gets lost in the frantic pace of GTA Online. Here, you can enjoy long rides through forests or take a break by a quiet river, relishing in the beauty of the surroundings. It's a place where you can just *be*, far from the hustle and bustle of city life, without feeling rushed to complete missions.

The role-playing aspect of Red Dead Online also sets it apart. While GTA Online allows for chaos, heists, and street racing, Red Dead Online takes a more thematic approach to gameplay. Players can choose from roles such as bounty hunter, trader, collector, or moonshiner—each with its own rich story and progression system. These roles feel deeply integrated into the world, giving each player a unique path and sense of purpose. The storylines, steeped in the gritty realism of the era, offer far more than just the occasional shootout or car chase; they’re about survival, camaraderie, and the harsh realities of life in a lawless land.

Additionally, Red Dead Online fosters a different kind of community. The stakes feel higher when you're working together to capture a bounty or protect a trading convoy, and there's a real sense of cooperation and camaraderie among players. The world encourages players to interact meaningfully rather than just compete against each other. In contrast, GTA Online can sometimes feel like a constant cycle of violence and destruction, with players focused on beating each other at every turn.

What truly elevates Red Dead Online above GTA Online, though, is its storytelling and atmosphere. The music, the voice acting, the ambiance—it all comes together to create a world that feels alive, echoing the themes of loss, redemption, and survival. There’s an emotional depth that GTA Online, with its neon lights and over-the-top antics, can’t quite replicate.

In conclusion, Red Dead Online isn’t just an online game; it’s a world to immerse yourself in. It offers an experience that combines the beauty of the Wild West with rich narratives, slower-paced exploration, and a unique sense of community that outshines the more frantic, high-energy world of GTA Online. It’s a masterpiece that stands as one of the most captivating multiplayer experiences out there, inviting players to step into a world full of stories, adventure, and breathtaking beauty.

every thing about this game is majestic. the graphics the story everything.

Friking incredible

Should be called Grand Theft Auto: Old West.

yeah yup yes

A lot of fun!!! It has story mode of course and a lot of free range i love it.

HORSEY GAME

This is my first time getting into the Red Dead Redemption franchise wagon, i have to say  i'm enjoying every minute & Seconds of this Wonderfully Crafted Game. i got it on sale for $20 because i was curious about it & was depressed and confused about life, on top of that i'm saving the main stories for later. I am exploring the side quest of this lively world First & for the people who contributed for the making of this game, may you live long Partner :}.

I thought it was only gonna be rootin'.

but then I found out it's also got the tootin'

wow

that is so insane Brenda, tell me more, but before you do;
10/10

Peak. Worth every cent and every second.

I hate story games. I have played many story games that I could never get into, but I can confidently say this is the best game I have ever played. This game was beautiful, good length, and an amazing story. I can confidently say that almost anyone will like this game's story. I played GTA V and I thought that was a good story game but it doesn't even come close to this masterpiece.

LumBagO



best game EVER

i actually finished the game, unlike @skninja who only plays fortnite

I wish I could replay this game without spoilers

The best game I ever played. First time I play this game, I stopped playing on chapter 2, but after half a year, I decided to play again and this time I was drawn in. In a week I reached chapter 6 and played this game 24 hours a day, I got high from the process, I advise everyone to play

i love thus game
10 out if 1-0

Ummmmm!!! get out from under your rock and play this game. Just go on Youtube and watch some of the amazing interactions!!!

Incredible graphics, that looks very realistic.! 😎  You can get your hat knocked away in this game. 

Good story ! Good voice acting ! Overall game is very good ! 

The worst part is additional 3rd party launcher. To be fair it’s not only Rockstar does that, but it’s still annoying.

BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED

This game cured my lumbago! The characters and story are written extremely well, makes up for Rockstar's greed. All the cowpokes agree. It is just so so so good! Classic.

Amazing Detail

GOAT

People without rdr2 be like: WE NEED MONEY, MONEY YOU FOOL

This is simply one of the most engaging pieces of media I've experienced in my lifetime. You will find detail no matter where you look, and that is certain. From the most monotonous of tasks to the most thrilling of shootouts, every action has a purpose and reason to it. Please do yourself a favor and purchase this game.

ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING I LOVE IT SO MUCH

PERFECT!

I love Arthur Morgan so much
Wish cowboy was real

best game ever made

Amazing Game, and so addicting. I can't believe I waited so long to play this!

Great cowboy simulator.

This game is fabulous. Every detail in this game shows how much love was put on it. The graphics are amazing and well crafted, things feels optimized and the art direction feels solid and consistent. 

The story is good, the mechanics feel great. Some may think this game is kinda slow, but it is not really the case, after the prologue and first missions you gonna find lot of things to do.

One thing I really love in this game is how rich the world is, the map is big, but it feels alive, it's full of random encounters and quests.   

It's a game that worth even at full price!

its really fun

its the best game ever made

cant hear shit

No blackjack online this is dumb asf, also one of the richest companies in gaming still can't deal with modders actually sad

best game end of story

Horrible story line. graphics are sub par.
DO NOT BUY!!

popiči

The story is amazing and it is so interactive and diverse.

I was lucky to be born at this exact time and on this exact planet, faced with the vastness of space and time. To have the chance to experience this masterpiece.



Couldn`t even launch the goddamn thing because of the dual launcher. Made the Rockstar acc, tried most recipes to get the game to launch - nothing worked. Hoping for my refund.

GTA but Western is how this game was described to me by my friend. His description has been proven accurate. I can rob a dude at shotgun point and then ride off into the sunset with my super cheap horse that I got the first time it forces you to buy a horse. I can run a random carriage off the trail and then loot their bodies and no one but me and my OBS software will know. I can get mauled by a bear while I idly sit in the middle of the woods while I'm doom scrolling on Ifunny instead of paying attention to my game. I know I'm a few years late to the game here but I recently upgraded my comp (finally) and now I can handle it. It's a great game so far and I look forward to dumping endless hours into it.

Jogo fantástico 🤩🤩🤩

Nothing else comes close. Best Story of any game I've ever played.

Very Great Game!

no exaggeration the greatest game i've ever played but now im depressed

Requires Rockstar Launcher.
Try to log in. Have to make an account in order to play -a singleplayer game-. Fine. Make new account. Your password is too weak. Make username. That username is taken. That other username is taken. Yes, the third one you tried is taken too. Retype password each time. Maybe try this username with a bunchanumbers at the end. Great, we have your email now. Enjoy the upcoming spam.
Oh, look at that. Apparently this game I just bought is already automatically tied to an old Rockstar account I barely used, maybe once for GTA4 back on '08, without any verification.
Fine, I try to remember password. Can't. Account is bound to an ancient email that I lost access to like a decade ago. Try to remember password to that, can't. It's been a decade, shoot me. Send password to sms instead, okay. Create new password. Confirm password login via sms via code. Re-log in email. Re-log in Rockstar launcher. Uninstall. Request refund. Worst 30 minutes ever. 
Launchers suck. Get rid of them. If your game is sold on Steam it should be playable directly from Steam, especially if it is a single player game. I was really excited to play this, too.

BEST GAME EVER MADE

masterpiece

i'm not creating a third party account just to play a game I've already paid for on Steam

yes


I had 300+ hours on playstation. Decided to get this for pc cause why not? Great game.

One of the greatest game I've even played.

I wake up → I put my cowboy hat on → I face my demons

GTA on horseback fun game

amazing just AMAZING A Masterpiece in the art of video games  so much to do so much to explore great Writing

Game good

yeehaw cowboy

Power went out as my game was auto saving and lost half of my progress (i was on ch 6, brought me back to my last manual save in ch 3) great game based on what I played but I'm gonna be grieving T-T

PLAY! PLAY! PLAY!!!

BEST RPG GAME EVER MADE IF YOU DONT PLAY THIS YOUR MISSING OUT

gerat game

WE JUST NEED MONEY!!

mid steamdeck runs 30 fps oline maybe 50 on windows if thas okay with you have fun


By far the best game I have ever played.

MASTERPIECE

This is more than a game, in my opinion. This is an experience. It will take you along a trip of excitement and tragedy, show you a diverse group of companions who I personally enjoyed, and ultimately serve as a very engaging and riveting game.

the best game in world really  most masterpiece game

-Horribly low FOV
-Lowest mouse DPI + lowes in game setting is barely playable
-Linear as F
-Press F to.. press R to.. press E to.. press a million buttons to interact
-Atrocious UI
-Blurry TAA
-Iron sights totally F up

Forcing myself to play (just giving it a chance).. got to a stage where I'm forced to buy a horse.. cannot even get to menu to quit (esc dont work).. I give horse name F U Rockstar, and the game wont let me name my horse because of profanity.. 

I force close game, go make review, uninstall. And making decision to never buy anything from Rockstar ever again.

10/10? No, 11/10!
Red Dead Redemption 2 is, without a doubt, the greatest game I have ever played. The dynamic world, the jaw-dropping visuals, and the gripping story make this game a masterpiece. But what really sets it apart is Arthur Morgan, the most immersive and well-developed main character ever created in gaming.
The attention to detail in this game is nothing short of incredible. The physics, especially the Rockstar physics, are revolutionary. The way everything interacts, from animals to the environment, makes the world feel so alive. And speaking of animals—the variety of species, fish, and wildlife is unmatched. It’s a hunting, fishing, and exploring paradise!
But that’s not all. There’s so much to do, from tons of side quests to hidden easter eggs scattered throughout. The NPCs have their own lives, routines, and conversations, making the world feel truly alive. Every corner holds something new, whether it’s a random encounter, a unique side mission, or a beautiful landscape to explore.
You should play this game. No doubt about it. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience. If you want to play the greatest game ever created, look no further than Red Dead Redemption 2.



obviamente buena



veri gud

Sem sombras de dúvidas um dos melhores jogos já feitos por um ser humano.

you sir are a fish

Eu me ajoelho para tamanha imundice que é esta empresa. Acabei de descobrir que existie um bug nessa carniça de jogo (desde de seu lançamento para PC) que não só desconecta o seu controle/dongle bluetooth; mas afeta todas as portas USB do seu computador. EM 2024 EU TIVE QUE ENTRAR NO MODO SEGURANÇA DO WINDOWS PARA CONSEGUIR RESSUCITAR MEU TECLADO E MOUSE POIS RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 DO COMPLETO NADA MATOU OS DRIVERS DO MEU COMPUTADOR.

INACREDTÁVEL. PARABÉNS. FELIZ NATAL. DEUS LHE PAGUE

Great game. Very chill, great story, graphics and action. Can get lost in the game though if you don't pay attention. 9.5/10

Rating: 9/10 (Outstanding)

Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most immersive, detailed, and emotionally resonant games ever made. While it’s not perfect, it’s an unforgettable journey through the dying days of the Wild West.

What I Loved:

    An Immersive World Like No Other:
    Rockstar has crafted a world that feels alive in every sense. The frontier is vast, diverse, and brimming with detail—from snow-capped mountains and dense forests to bustling towns and desolate plains. Every corner of the map feels handcrafted, with random events and encounters making the world feel dynamic. Simply riding through the wilderness is an experience in itself.

    A Gripping, Emotional Story:
    The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang is masterfully told. It’s a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and the struggle to find redemption in a world that’s leaving the outlaw lifestyle behind. Arthur is one of the most compelling protagonists in gaming, with a character arc that’s both powerful and heartbreaking.

    Unparalleled Attention to Detail:
    RDR2 is a technical marvel. From the way mud clings to your boots to the way your horse’s mane sways in the wind, every detail is meticulously crafted. NPCs have their own routines and react to your actions in believable ways, adding to the immersion. Even the little things, like cleaning your guns or shaving your beard, help sell the authenticity of the world.

    Diverse Gameplay:
    There’s so much to do, from hunting legendary animals and playing poker to tracking bounties and robbing trains. The variety of activities ensures the game stays engaging, whether you’re focused on the main story or just living life as an outlaw.

    Incredible Audio and Visuals:
    The visuals are breathtaking, with stunning lighting and landscapes that feel painterly. The sound design is equally impressive, with a memorable soundtrack and ambient sounds that bring the frontier to life. The voice acting, especially Roger Clark as Arthur, is phenomenal, elevating the emotional weight of the story.

What I Didn’t Love:

    Slow Pacing:
    RDR2 is deliberately slow, and while this works to immerse you in the world, it can be a barrier for some players. Animations are lengthy, travel takes time, and missions often unfold at a leisurely pace. If you’re not patient, this might feel like a chore.

    Clunky Controls and Mechanics:
    While the game excels in realism, this sometimes comes at the expense of responsiveness. Arthur’s movements can feel sluggish, and the controls, particularly in combat, can be frustratingly imprecise.

    Repetition in Missions:
    Many story missions follow a familiar formula: ride to a location, shoot your way out, escape. While the storytelling is top-notch, the gameplay within missions doesn’t always match the same level of variety.

    Open-World Fatigue:
    With so much to do, the game can feel overwhelming. The sheer number of systems—like managing your camp, maintaining your horse, and keeping Arthur fed and clean—might feel unnecessary or tedious for some players.

Overall Thoughts:

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a monumental achievement in gaming. Its story, world, and attention to detail set a new standard for open-world games. While the slow pacing and clunky mechanics may deter some players, those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most immersive and emotionally rich experiences in gaming.

Pros:

    Stunning, immersive open world.
    A powerful and emotional story with memorable characters.
    Unmatched attention to detail in visuals, audio, and world-building.
    Diverse gameplay activities that capture the essence of the Wild West.

Cons:

    Slow pacing might frustrate impatient players.
    Controls and mechanics can feel clunky.
    Some repetitive mission structures.
    Open-world systems might feel overwhelming or unnecessary.

Recommendation:
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play for anyone who values storytelling, immersion, and a rich open world. It’s not a game that rushes you—it’s one you savor. While not without its flaws, it’s a masterpiece that deserves its place as one of the best games of its generation.

Requires me to register for essentially what I wanted to play as single player game.
No way to avoid registration to play said single player only version of game.
Wont ever buy any rockstar games again. Not unless they remove launcher bullshi*.

My steam account was apparently linked to a different Rockstar Account so I had to mess about with support to be able to play it...

Massive mood killer...installed to play it and I can't because of the stupid launcher login is tied to my old MS Hotmail email account!! You can't even resolve the problem yourself. Utter....utter BS!!!

F U Rockstar!! Wasting my time and money....

0/10

This game is my favorite video game of all time, because of the sheer quality it has. It is basically a 1-to-1 replica of America in the late 1800s and early 1900s, from transportation to interactions with people and the political state (I can go on). Everything is pretty accurate to the time. One of the key parts of this game is the [b]beautiful story[/b]. Yes, some chapters are boring, and some are useless [spoiler](Chapter 5 )[/spoiler], but this game has one of [b]the most compelling story lines of any video game[/b]. I don't cry about things much, especially video games, but this story [spoiler](especially at the end)[/spoiler] makes you [u]overwhelmed with emotions[/u]—[b]fear[/b], [b]sadness[/b], [b]anger[/b], [b]aggression[/b], (insert dramatic emotion HERE)—that the only way to free those emotions is by crying. Even if the story has been fully spoiled to you, you still feel all of those emotions.

[hr][/hr]
[b] Should you buy it? [/b] [u]Absolutely[/u], and if money is a problem just wait. This game goes on sale like every other week.

As it is now I can't play the game in PC without going through a bunch of hoops. I would not recommend this game to anyone just because of their obnoxious launcher that requires you to make an account and should always be online. But the most grievous offense they did is that their launcher won't even acknowledge the fact that I bought the game, due to an activation error. Let it be known that I have nothing against the game itself but how the heck can anyone play it if the launcher is shit.

Red Dead Redeption 2, as of December 2024, requires you to have steam (a launcher program) open while playing and also requires you have rockstar launcher open while playing, to constantly verify your account isn't pirated and that you're not cheating during multi-player content.  I only want to play single-player, offline.  I do not want to play any kind of multi-player content.  I do not agree to rockstar's terms of service because i don't want to use their service in the first place.  I want a stand-alone, single player, offline product, not a service.  So to get that I'm going to go get an "alternate" copy, and play this game the way I want to play.  to hell with 3rd party launchers.  to hell with DRM in single player experiences.  companies should know better, and if they won't learn then the right thing for consumers to do is look to the high seas for objectively better options.

Cant even play the game due to my account being connected to a old rockstar account that i have no way of getting to. i was with support for 3-4 hours with 6-7 different people. just to be told they can't do anything about it.

Originally played around 2021, but came back for 2nd playthrough in 2024 due to pre-GTA 6 copium

-Still holds up graphically
-Slow burn game, you're here to chill around the campfire
-Action set pieces (main story) is absolute cinema
-Soundtrack is peak and carries every moment especially main plot points
-Very good story and dialogue, makes you care about Arthur's journey and the gang
-Authentic cowboy feel with the gunslinging (revolver fanning), horse-riding and the lassoing

-"WE JUST NEED...MORE...MONEY"

-Gorgeous IMMERSIVE open world full of nature and wildlife, didn't care for hunting in 1st playthrough, but eventually found it very fun on the 2nd when you're using all the tools given.
-Very immersive gameplay, you can set up camp to pass the time, cook or fast travel, game has item pickup/ loot animation with your hands (probably gets old after the 10th time)
-YOU ACTUALLY BROWSE THE STORE AND EXAMINE THE ITEMS WITH YOUR HANDS
-Stores have cool looking catalogue with the period-correct illustrations

-"I HAVE A GODDAMN PLAN ARTHUR"

-Very good sidequests and random events
-Very detailed gore (shoot someone in the neck and watch them panic as they bleed out)
-You can lasso someone from your horse and drag them across the state
-They've written the gangs to be absolute scum you can massacre without hesitation

Didn't bother with online

Overall 10/10 partly due to me being a rockstar fanboy.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute gem in the world of gaming. Made by Rockstar Games, this game takes you on an epic journey through the Wild West, and it's not just a game—it's an experience.

Graphics and Sound: The graphics are absolutely stunning, with beautiful landscapes and incredible attention to detail. The sound design is top-notch too, from the ambient sounds of nature to the amazing soundtrack that really pulls you into the game.

Gameplay: The gameplay is diverse and fun, with a mix of action, exploration, and storytelling. There's so much to do, from hunting and fishing to intense shootouts. The controls are smooth and easy to get the hang of, making it easy to lose yourself in the world of Red Dead Redemption 2.


I had a hard time lunching the game because of a lost Rockstar game account.
Even tho you bought your games on steam, Rockstar force you to log in to their system.

It took me hours :/ So make sure you have your logins !

The game is probably great, but getting in was frustrating and unnecessary.

this game is amazing. It does start slow but gets way batter the further you progress. I have spent almost 800 hours just replaying this game and finding new collectibles and i still have yet to find everything and also this game looks amazing.

Beautiful game.  Lots to do.
Save mechanics and clunky controls make it horrible to play.
I understand its a port but take some time to retool for the greatness that is the PC market.  Save system feels like an afterthought.

Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. The atmosphere pulls you in, the visuals are absolutely stunning, and the score perfectly sets the tone for every moment. The narrative? It’s in a league of its own. The characters, the story, the emotions—it’s all so well done, it feels like living in a cinematic masterpiece. Every detail, big or small, is crafted with so much care that it’s hard not to be completely immersed. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of this century. If you haven’t played it yet, you’re missing out on something truly special.

As Arthur Morgan would say: “I guess... I’m afraid.” Afraid I’ll never find another game this good.

10/10

This was less of a game, and more a movie that you hold a controller for. In such a diverse and detailed environment, there should have been far more player-based choices available, and the forced linearity of the story seriously took away from the wild-west outlaw feel. Despite multiple endings, they’re all relatively the same, and they’re mostly determined by a single decision at the very end. The aim assist is also way too strong, creating a negative skill expression in comparison to every other game that exists. [I felt more skill expression from Backyard Baseball.] If you’re new to gaming, looking for an escape, want a fishing simulator,  or want a peaceful environment to stroll through, this game is for you. If you’re a serious gamer who seeks adrenaline surges and skill expression, this is absolutely not for you.

===The Good==
-Growing Storyline; learning new information feels natural
-Proper Cowboy Humor
-Horse Mechanics; only possible addition to the current design is hoof-work
-Skinning Mechanics; accurate and adaptive-per-animal. Takes time, but not too much
-DARK Dark
-External research is not required for an encompassing Red Dead experience

===The Bad===
-Game Speed. Forced camp-walk is wildly irritating. Looting/Searching takes way too long for multiple reasons [including individualized animations, character cannot be moving when inputting ‘search’ function, character momentum dis-aligns ‘search’ function, etc.]. Following your allies is a huge waste of time. Fishing is accurate but takes too much effort and time. Forced walking in many random locations is pointless. Many urgent scenarios will leave you standing around/moving at minimum possible speed, and character animations have your avatar fumbling around for the right spot to interact in, long after your inputs.
-Weapons disappearing. It’s one thing for your weapons to be holstered after an extended period without use while on horseback, it’s another to have no primary weapons equipped for multiple missions where your horse is also unavailable. Scavenging is always a great gameplay element, but you should have ready-access to the weapons you’ve obtained, outside of situations like kidnapping and jail. 
-Menu Formatting. Who the hell designed these menus? Fire them. Brightness wasn’t available anywhere in-game. You have General, Camera, Display, Graphics, NONE of these contain brightness, and somehow the most BASIC display function was buried in a terrible layout. ‘Save’ also isn’t up-front, and the menus won’t tell you why ‘Save’ is locked. The navigation system fails to understand your ability to traverse a topo-map, and sends you on goose chases instead of cutting through mountains. You have to pause to look at the map, also pausing recovery for your/horse’s stamina bar[s] when it realistically should take place. However, the in-game maps actually function in this manner, causing further inconsistencies.
-This game needs WAY more opportunities for player-based choices. It provides a bountiful number of playstyle options and storylines that got completely sidelined or overlooked. They’re mildly present, but should be much more numerous, and should have far greater influence on the outcome of the storyline.
-Save Mechanics. Manual save is available, but is buried within the menus when this should be an up-front feature in all games that involve saving. There is an autosave feature, but it doesn’t activate before entering a no-save zone. More often than not, you can’t save when you want to. Had multiple instances where I couldn’t save in my own camp. Save files randomly reverted multiple times, forcing me to repeat the same missions and endure the ridiculously slow camp walk & runback times I’ve already pushed through. 
-Stealth Failures. Allies will shout your name in the middle of a robbery. You robbed a bank with your sheriff’s badge still on. You take the time to pick a new name and still choose “Arthur”. You hear the farmer tell the deputies about the noise in the barn, but you can’t leave? I kill the intruder with a knife, my gun-wielding allies flame me for making noise as they pop-off shots. Forced into a firefight from a tattered barn that would provide zero protection, forced to stay inside as the enemies are throwing molotovs. Dutch, your “brilliant” leader is shouting your character’s real name again during the biggest robbery. The brainlessness kills me as a stealth gamer, but what really upset me was: both before and after this mission, the house where the stranger reported the barn noises is actually boarded up and marked vacant for purpose of repossession. There was never anyone in this house. Karen calls Bill by name & Arthur takes his mask off in the bank during the robbery, BUT NOT HIS SHERIFF’S BADGE? It’s a criminally inaccurate depiction of what crime would actually require.
-Aim assist is way too strong in this game. I pride myself on accuracy in shooters, and I struggled severely to get my reticle on any target other than my first, significantly reducing my accuracy due to the overcompensation required. This became more and more frustrating as I played the game because my intended targets were disregarded for a different enemy that was behind me/completely off-screen. 

===The Ugly==
-Wagon wheel breaks, and we fix it by doing… nothing at all
-Can’t change/remove articles of clothing while riding
-Multiple grammatical errors present in the first 2 chapters alone
-Baby Deer survived 6 rounds of .44 magnum and ran away
-Put a dead bullfrog in my bag?? And blood-soaked bird carcasses. With my biscuits and everything.
-STATIONARY CANNON clips the walls, a clear lack of game-testing
-Camping has way too many stipulations that prevent you from setting up, and most of the time it doesn’t even tell you why, just “Cannot set up camp right now”
-1 quest directs me to commit a crime. Next quest cannot be started due to crimes committed in the previous quest. No forewarning provided
-I guess Arthur can’t swim
-“I don’t speak German”, then proceeds to understand multiple sentences in German
-Calls to Action [assisting in kidnappings, police chases, etc.] do not yield the expected results, often end in negative consequences rather than positive ones
-Attempting to reach my horse failed multiple missions due to proximity without warning
-Attempting to kill a bounty’s horse [before fleeing/mounting] failed the mission as “Spooked”
-Firearms equipped on horseback that are not in use should remain in inventory when dismounting, not unequipped automatically. [Holstering would be acceptable, unequipping entirely is not]
-the post-island audio track has tons of unmastered pops & clicks; this can potentially damage your speakers
-certain Horse Mechanics [Trample-murdering a man standing 20ft away, eating shit & dying on a 2ft. fall, trample-murdering civilians while in auto-pilot/cinematic mode, etc.]
-Clothing reverts at random, even after saving your outfit
-Starting a mission removes your ability to set up camp, sleep, shave, change clothes, etc. 
-Being bald will prevent you from advancing in the main storyline. [Again, clear & obvious lack of game testing]
-General Realism failures; My horse used a sandwich board as a stunt ramp to catapult me into a ceiling and fail a mission instead of just knocking the sandwich board over. A hat will save enemies from a neckshot, law officers will appear out of nowhere when no communication would be possible to dispatch them. You can find belt buckles, but can’t equip them or change them. You have space for canned vegetables, but no more space for platinum rings? A hot air balloon didn’t take damage from any of the countless bullets being fired??

Imagine not letting players play offline OR even simply just signing into a different rockstar account to play the damn game. Tell me why I can't even log into THE ACCOUNT THAT IS LINKED TO MY STEAM because they won't let me reset my password. I will never support this bs company and the stupidest practices that they think is just the most wonderful idea they've ever had. game is 10000/10 but because its made by rockstar never will be worth it -100000000/10 fuck you rockstar.

One of the best games I’ve played in my four decades of gaming, Red Dead Redemption 2 stands out for its gripping story and unforgettable characters. Following Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, weaving a tale of loyalty and survival, filled with complex, emotionally rich characters.

The open world is equally impressive, offering a living, breathing environment where exploration is endlessly rewarding. From hunting in the mountains to fishing by a river, and thrilling activities like train robbing and intense story and side missions, the game’s attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience. On top of that, the in-game challenges—whether it’s mastering hunting, collecting rare items, or surviving the brutal landscape—add an extra layer of depth to the adventure.

With stunning visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and a deeply emotional narrative, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play. Everyone needs to experience it.

A nice game, very realistic. Landscapes are sublime, story is great, and the dialogues are top-notch. Just the gameplay is a bit too easy; shots to you are flesh wounds but shots to enemies are lethal. A good game though, of very high quality. Maybe as it is very realistic, it's a bit more for Western movie fans, while others might find it a bit boring.

Honestly holds up and continues to be one of the best games till this very day. There is nothing like this and another game has yet to live up to it in my eyes. Originally had nearly 100 hours on console prior to playing on PC.

Play online for the first time some how ended up in a chinese sever even tho im in america, them blasting asian music though the mic LOUD AF , 2 second later getting jump by all of them got hog tie and fed to alligator (they kill my horse) 
10/10 every realistic

The story is magnificent. It's true that it starts off slow, but once you get into it and look around in the plot, it suddenly has an immersive atmosphere, and it's hard not to keep going. Personally, as someone who played the original back during the Xbox 360 era, I wasn't a huge fan of the series. The first game didn't seem bad, but it also didn't feel like my cup of tea. However, after the second game, it's a 180-degree turn.

As Rockstar Games typically does, they raise the technical level with each of their major titles, and this one is no exception. The attention to detail, the liveliness of the environment, random events, the feature set available to the player, and the diversity and size of the map are all spectacular.

I was especially surprised by how they managed to bring Arthur Morgan to life. As a player of the original game, I didn't expect the prequel to RDR1 to be told from a different perspective than John's, but the opposite is true. I ended up liking Arthur even more than John. He's a very likable character who undergoes development throughout the story and grows on you more and more.


SPOILERS AHEAD!













I was greatly impressed by the inclusion of the RDR1 map, which offers a beautiful connection to the original game since it’s a prequel, and the story tells how John left his gang. However, this original map shows me why RDR1 wasn't as successful in my eyes—the map is very empty, mostly deserts and uninteresting places. In RDR2, this isn’t an issue, as the map for the RDR2 story is full of vibrant environments like the mountains from the first chapter or the forests and swamps from the next part of the plot. The connection between Arthur Morgan's and John Marston's stories couldn't be better, and the game gets a perfect score from me. Arthur Morgan's story was very well-written, and it’s a shame when the game ends, as it’s followed by the epilogue with John, and we no longer get to play as Arthur :(

I've thought a lot about this, and while there's a lot to enjoy here, the ultimate reason for the down vote is that the glitches and frustrations that exist in the game shouldn't exist in a AAA title. I ultimately uninstalled the game uncompleted, though perhaps one day I will pick it up again.

I think this game, especially on sale, will give you some decent open world enjoyment. The story, when it finally gets going, is superbly told - good voice acting, great cinematics, awesome tone - but there's a lot of downtime between the momentum. You can fill this down time with some great stuff - fishing, hunting, bounty collecting, robbing - but eventually those will all get boring. Or maybe they won't for you, but for me, none of that really got me excited after the first few times. So the game's story is told in waves - high highs and low lows of energy.

The map is fantastic. The locations feel dynamic and things do feel like they're happening around you.

And there is a lot of content. At the time of this review, I am apparently only 50% through the story. But let me be clear - the majority of my hours were not story but basic maintenance (making money) doing things that, while fun at first, quickly began to feel like more chores. Some of the side quests are genuinely interesting, but they are still just side quests - which means I'm not here for them. I'm here for the main story.

But the ultimate reason I down vote this title is because this is a AAA game whose audio snaps, crackles, and pops. I did find a fix, but it's not a sure fix; every now and then the audio starts cracking again.

The user interface is the worst I've seen in a game, with hotkeys buried behind hotkeys. In all fairness, there is a lot that your character can do, but it doesn't change the fact that the wheel key and the deadeye key are right next to each other so you constantly run the risk of holstering your weapon when you're just trying to aim your gun. And the keys seem random, too - once the game told me to pick up my hat with one button and then my gun with another. No idea why.

The games over-design is actually built into the UI; your possible actions always show in the bottom right hand of the screen. It's like the developers knew you'd have a hard time remembering all the commands and so built a never-ending tutorial into the game.

And no, I don't care that the game's poor UI is probably the result of it being ported from console. They can port the game better or not at all; I'll judge the game on its merits as presented.

And it's very annoying to walk over an item 8 million times in hopes of picking it up.

But if that wasn't enough for me to hate the game, stupid shit happens all the time. The boxing mechanic randomly quits, so you'll sit there and take hit after hit without being able to punch back because, for whatever reason, the key doesn't work. And once a guy started jabbering at me on the street. I tried to defuse the situation - a command you can press in the game - but I couldn't because the button grays out when someone is talking or when you're getting off your horse. By the time the guy shut up long enough for me to press the relevant button, he'd decided to pull out a knife and throw down with me. I didn't pull a gun out, but the cops still came and shot me. 10/10 for realism, maybe, but 0/10 for good gameplay.

Game crashes on achievements sometimes - no idea why.

There are other things, too. And so while the story of Arthur Morgan is pretty good, it's a story that not only crawls at a snail's pace but takes frequent breaks, too. And it's filled with glitches and mechanics that prove frustrating,

"You're a good man, Arthur Morgan." This is the best and most beautiful game I've ever played. The world feels alive and the characters feel real, Arthur especially. I've never felt so in-tune with a character before. Rockstar created a masterpiece. It's only a shame that they don't still support the game like they should.

i own this game but can't play it because i need to login to a rockstar account that I don't have access to. It won't let me unlink it either because again, i do not have access to this account.

Why are secondary launchers allowed on steam?

Yeehaw, partner! If you're looking for an epic, immersive Wild West adventure, look no further than Red Dead Redemption 2. Arthur Morgan and John Marston are two badass outlaws you'll love to hate (or hate to love?). These gunslingers can't seem to stay out of trouble, whether it's getting into bar brawls, robbing trains, or escaping the law.
The level of detail in this game is off the charts - you can literally bathe, brush your horse, and even wrangle a bear with your bare hands (not recommended). The open world is so massive, it'll make your head spin faster than a tumbleweed. Want to go hunting? Fishing? Gambling? It's all here, partner.
Just be prepared to get your boots dirty. This ain't no walk in the park. Red Dead Redemption 2 will test your patience, your stamina, and your trigger finger. But if you can handle the gritty, grueling life of an outlaw, this game will rope you in and never let go. Yee-haw!
And if you're a deranged masochist, you can also try the Online mode, where you'll be ruthlessly gunned down by trigger-happy maniacs and cackling cheaters at every turn. May God have mercy on your soul, cowpoke.

why do i need another launcher too play this game, and its so slow. if i can refund this game i would but sadly i already play this game for 5 hours. hate it HATE IT.

you can do just about everything and the open world looks and feels amazing

I love RDR2. The PC version for me however is the buggiest game I have ever played. I've already verified the game files twice because of 3 instances of the game breaking and not allowing me to progress. Currently, I'm stuck in the mission when you have to take the carriage to Valentine in the beginning of the game, because after the carriage was repaired, the horses WILL NOT move.

One of the greatest game i ever played, and my personal favorite too. can't stop playing while looking at this game's environment and beauty.

lost access to an email that was linked to my Rockstar account
the Rockstar support is **** In all of my life I have never faced such @##|#{ of a scum.
Don't BUY rockstar games.

one of my favourite games oat. story mode is amazing and the online aspect is fun too. worth the ultimate

Best game ever made and played and will be in human history. Some things will change your life for the better and this is one of that things and it changed me into viewing the world in a positive way. Everyone should play this at least in once in their life time. For me the this is the winner in the 2018 TGA. And the soundtrack makes you feel goosebumps and takes you to 1899. I am playing it in 2024 after 6 years from its release and today's games still didn't even touch its greatness and it'll be the same till GTA VI releases:)...
  
Thank you rockstar for this masterpiece;).....

This game is an absolute Masterpiece. It's hard to do a proper review of a game like this without massive spoilers, so I'lll keep it short. Rockstar really knocked it outta the park with Red Dead Redemption 2. Before I played this, Witcher 3 was my favorite game, but now this is either tied or fully takes top spot for me. The story is so well done, very captivating. The world is top notch, beautiful and huge with tons of things to do and discover if you just go out exploring. They really captured the brutality of that time period with the way the story is written. The characters are fantastic, music is perfect, graphics are some of the best I've seen, gun play is very satisfying, I love hitting headshots with the explosive ammo.

When I started playing this game, I didn't really know what I was in for. I was enjoying it, but wasn't sure if I'd stick with it. Soon I was hooked and really invested in the characters. Arthur Morgan is one of the best characters of any game, great personality. I like how the player can choose to be good or bad and it shapes how the game turns out. Honestly, I was blown away with the quality of RDR2 and can't wait for RDR3 to come out. I wish there were more games of this caliber available, more studios should strive to make great games like this one. I felt like I was part of the whole thing and experiencing the emotions of the characters. I would've done a few things different, but man, this is such a good game. I recommend it to anyone who likes amazing, immersive games. Might take you a bit to get hooked, but when you do you'll truly enjoy your time playing it, I know I did.

 This may be the most boring game I have ever played, mostly because of the horrible save system (you may want to turn off autosave, as it just makes a mess of things).  You have to repeat the same endless journeys on horseback constantly.   The rewards are so few.  The excitement so rare.  The side quests are 90% worthless so far.  I am only in Chapter 2, but I've had enough of this piece of garbage.  I just don't get it.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is hands down one of the best games I’ve ever played. The story is insanely good, Arthur Morgan is an unforgettable character, and the world feels so alive it’s like stepping into the Wild West. The music, the details, and even the little moments are just perfect.

If you haven’t played it yet, you’re missing out.

I am a variety gamer, so I can stomach a lot of different controls and settings across many genres. But you would be hard pressed to find a worse control scheme in any game for mouse and keyboard. It is completely nuts you need to press few different buttons to interact with a drawer and every action, even the most minute one asks you to click something else. It's not immersion, if I need to learn to code to enjoy a game - it's sheer madness.
The game is gorgeous to look at and the story could be interesting but I am not optimistic reading advice saying 'you just need 20-30hrs to get the hang of buttons'. Maybe I'm just too old but I want to enjoy a game from the get go and not learn a piano. 
For that reason I can't recommend the game.

I haven't felt this level of immersion since Barbie Horse Adventures. The only critique I have is lack of hair accessories for horse, otherwise it's the best experience I've ever had in a video game by far.

It looks pretty and the setting is cool, but the gameplay blows. I'll probably keep playing. Because I paid 27 euros for it. Edit: I've kept playing and it hasn't gotten better. At the moment I'm more or less just hateplaying it to kill time.

Do I enjoy it? Is it a fun game or is it a dour slog filled to the brim with hammy acting and seemingly endless "walk/ride with me for 20 minutes while I deliver some pointless exposition" in a huge but essentially empty map? Take a wild guess.

Warning, all unsaved progress will be lost if you want to quit to desktop! So how do I know if my game is saved? Fuck you, you don't. 

OK, so I'll save manually just to be safe. Fuck you, are you crazy?? You think we're a game with a well thought out design? Have you seen our key mapping?

Speaking of, I'd like to remap a key tied to a specific action. Fuck you, that key is also bound to 14 other actions.

Centering the item storage management system on the saddle of the main horse seems like a particularly poor choice when that horse apparently stumbles on a straw of grass, tumbles over and fucking dies, leaving all your stuff stranded in the middle of nowhere. Fuck you, and start walking. 

I'll just set up camp at a random spot out in the wilderness, fast travel back to main camp and get another horse. Fuck you, there's an activity nearby. 

What activity? Fuck you, that's what. 

OK, I'll just start walking then. Fuck you, here's a zillion bounty hunters for your troubles. Now die.

By the way, why is there a 54 second unskippable cinematic with cheesy imagery and even cheesier music playing [i]every time[/i] I want to "fast" travel, thus negating the purpose as well as its name? Fuck you, that's why. 

And why do I have to spend 10-15 seconds looking at a pointless animation [i]every time[/i] I skin an animal or cook something? Fuck you, we work in an industry apparently staffed entirely by failed wannabe filmmakers. If we're not allowed to make proper movies we can at least force you to watch our animations by spraying them all over our alleged game. How else are we going to inflate time played by literal hours?

Why do I have to go to the saddle and retrieve my weapons [i]every time[/i] I get off a horse? Fuck you, we're all about [i]realism[/i] and [i]immersion[/i] man! 

So why is there magic vision and slow motion if you have realism and immersion as cornerstones? Fuck you, that's why.

At the moment I'm carrying two Colt Single Action Army revolvers with 400 rounds, one Spencer Model 1865 Carbine repeater with 400 rounds, and a Winchester Model 1890 varmint rifle with 300 rounds, which adds up to 25 kilo in weight. And that's not counting all the stuff in my satchel which must weigh at least as much. It seems like your [i]realism[/i] and [i]immersion[/i] excuse is quite poor. Fuck you, nerd!

Why do I have to press the shoot button after [i]every time[/i] I have fired off a round to get the next one into the chamber? Fuck you and keep pushing, button monkey.

What do the camp upgrades actually do before I spend my hard earned cash on them? Fuck you, that's what. Give me your money (the perfect metaphor for Rockstar if ever there was one).

It's amazing how they seemingly go out of their way to make the gameplay as cumbersome as possible. 

Edit: I had to turn off the comments thanks to some pathetic little fanboy crying about me not liking his favorite game. I have better things to do with my time than trying to decipher and respond to inane ramblings.

My favourite story game ever, im not really into the "wild west" and "cowboy" theme, but the story just is too good, however the game is very spoiler sensitive, so i suggest go play it with no spoilers, also tha game teaches very nice life lessons, graphics are very good, open world map is beautiful and the game overall is ahead of competition when it was first released, and even till this day this game never lost its charm. I reccomend this game to every single person.

Probably the best story game ever produced, would play again and again.

I really really tried to like this game but it has very clunky controls on PC in my opinion. No matter what I did (changed graphics just about a dozen times all the way from min to max) I could not get this game to run smoothly.

One of those epic games that define a generation and push the limits of whats possible on a game engine.
The amount of detail and perfection and man hours put into this masterpiece, cannot be Overstated.

Rockstar can add as much detail as they want, I won’t give this game a positive review after all the shit they put me through. The requirements for getting 100% achievement completion are just pure anguish.

Online Mode is a disaster with a broken economy, an awful grind for revenue, and terrible design. The reward system is a joke. You get more money and gold for spending an extraordinary amount of time on a mission. So I’m forced to idle for half an hour to reap the maximum reward. And what do I get? Barely enough to afford one weapon or a piece of clothing. And all of this just because Rockstar wants to milk you with microtransactions. Fuck right off.

As for Story Mode, yes it is a masterpiece with a grand level of immersion. However, the amount of bullshit thrown at you for the prior mentioned achievements is an utter piss-take. I'm not having a great time when I’m forced to close and load into the game 20-30 times just to document a single animal out of the 200-something. The amount of stuff you have to do is already absurd, but introducing a random number generator into the mix? I must have browsed through hundreds of tutorials for this game alone, just to accomplish a menial task.

You eventually hit a point where the immersion building in this game becomes tedious. An animation for looting every single item in a cupboard, skinning a variety of different animals, or a general slow-pacing for absolutely everything is just testing my patience when I’m forced to see it for the hundredth time.

As awful as Online Mode is with hackers ruining your experience or even causing your entire game to crash, at least it has a ton of gunplay. In retrospect, there is little shooting action in Story Mode. At least by comparison. I don’t just want to watch characters yapping for the sake of world-building, I demand action. Especially from a game that is supposedly set in the Wild West.

Most realistic game I've ever played. There are so many possibilities that almost all of them are possible for you  to do, like real life. Don't even get me started on the details of this game. The game isn't repetitive and takes time to complete. The best part is, when you've completed the game, you can start over without losing your old data.

Game is kinda slow for my patience but it is very good. It's like being in a wild west world with lots of freedom. I'll finish it eventually. I keep getting distracted by random events :P

Western Type Vibe for this game is super nice. Just remember it is pretty authentic as well, so no Fast travel or screen cuts, for some. Overall a Classic good game choice.

Beautiful Game, Rich Story telling. Even though it has ALOT of bugs, glitches and crashes, including a train one i got when i opened a drawer on a random event. and make sure your computer can run it, i have a 3060 and i had to put it on medium settings, i get 100-110 fps.

Don't buy games from Rockstar, i bought this game december for 2023 and i was playing fine, now because of some messed up update, their Rockstar Launcher don't let me play with my main account and are asking me to login with an old e-mail I don't have access to. I'm basically lock out of play GTA IV, V and Red Dead Redemption 2, games that i bought it, all because of their DRM Launcher, and their support don't help with anything, is all automated and if you talk to a real person, they don't help a all, i basically bought digital paper weight. Don't buy from them, there's plenty of good games on Steam that wont lock you out of playing for some arbitrary BS. I was playing RDR2 fine when i bought it and was using my main account.

Bought it and spent an hour trying to solve the BS captcha. I know what a ****ing bus looks like, but according to rockstar I'm not allowed to play a game I bought.

Also, this is the 2nd time I have had to do this since steam removed my review for no reason.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece that sets the standard for storytelling and world-building in gaming. Rockstar has crafted a sprawling, dynamic world filled with unforgettable characters and emotional depth that pulls you in from the very first mission. The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang is one of the most compelling narratives in gaming, blending moments of heartbreak, camaraderie, and redemption with exceptional writing and voice acting.

The level of detail in the game world is astonishing. From the bustling towns to the quiet wilderness, every inch of the map feels alive. Even after completing the main story, RDR2 invites you back for a second or third playthrough, offering new perspectives and paths to explore.

The only downside is the online mode, Red Dead Online, which has been largely abandoned by Rockstar. Plagued by cheaters and exploiters, it fails to capture the magic of the single-player experience and often feels frustrating and unbalanced.

Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play for anyone who values rich storytelling and immersive worlds. It’s an unforgettable experience that continues to reward players long after the credits roll.

know this before you buy:
1. single player story mode game requires installation and use of rockstar launcher
2. single player story mode game requires installation and use of social club app installed with launcher
3. single player story mode game requires social club account and log in to play
4. worst one. single player story mode game requires internet connection to rockstar/social club for the gate keepers to grant you access to a game you paid for and are supposed to own or error message and closure of game

fun feels like a movie good graphics and gamplay

best story game ever made. few bugs but you can fix them easily. Would highly recommend to anyone

I love being a cowboy and doing cowboy things. Took me a bit to get the controls down because I never really played video games much (I accidentally kicked some animals while learning to play.) I'm a big fan of the horses, although I have no idea how to get a good one. I'll work on that.

The most masterpiece game ever!
What a good story, what a big drama, absolute cinema.
Absolute masterpiece 10/10

Rockstar at its best. This game is a generational experience that everyone should take a chance to enjoy

the best video game I've ever played hands down.

most compelling and devastating story I've ever experienced

High learning curve but once you get used to the buttons, it's hard to pull yourself away from this game

I have passed this game about 4 times already and i got to say this is one of the best games still in 2024. If you like story-driven games, this game is for you. this game is might be the one of the best story lines in gaming history in my personal experience. Everything is nice about this game, the graphics, the story, and the realism in the game is outstanding. But what do you expect? Its Rockstar Games, their games are always the best.

Its amazing
The Graphics are 10/10 and runs smoothly. The Story is simply superb with amazing writing all around and expertly crafted characters on which all of them feel utterly realistic in ways words can not describe. The world of RDR2 is also a character in of itself with such uniqueness and fidelity there is boundless content with side missions and other extras to be found just about everywhere.
Overall this game gets 5 booms out of 5 booms.
Go away now and get the game, you got some trains to rob.

Long epic story and good characters 9/10

This is one of the best game I have ever played strong story impressive graphics but the sad part is this game has an ending which is the most heart breaking thing.

Probably my favorite game of all time. I find it very easy to immerse myself in this games world and get totally lost in the visuals. Such a beautiful game world!

This game is truly a masterpiece. Wait for the sale season and buy the game. You won't regret it GG

Best Game! Its Pretty Good. But To Fit Well If You'd Rather Have Fun Is Some Mods Like Rampage With LML!

I got this for Christmas and so far its been so good. Even though I already watched a play through of this, its far different from what I watched ( at chapter 4 now)

I knew this game from very long it existed and my god when saw its gameplay in gaming channels i was astonished by the setup of world . I have always wanted to play this game from then. Then in this steam sale i got to know it is sold in good price and got it and downloaded it right away! My GODDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a story ! What a work of art in setting up the whole world ! No doubt why this game got so many awards ! 2 weeks of gameplay with my semester exams and 48h in-game hours i completed 50 percent of the game and it is pullling me in ! After the exam i will surely continue and complete this game and then play this game again only to explore the worldd! THIS IS ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE! ARTHUR MORGAN FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111

very nice game. its just that if you have a regular laptop, the game will stutter even with low graphics. an actual pc is recommended.
