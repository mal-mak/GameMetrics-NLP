Prepare to face off against a city of homicidal crackheads with John Wick level accuracy while sprinting and absolutely no sense of preservation. The fictional city of Los Suenos has been overrun by merciless mass shooters who regularly eat rifle rounds for breakfast. Check your corners and get some friends to watch your back. Would absolutely recommend for the horror atmosphere and pulse pounding jumpscares that happen every time you meet a thug with a gun.

Some desirable cosmetics are unobtainable if you're a latecomer. Do not buy, do not support.

I'm told it's a spiritual successor to the SWAT games. Fun with a lot of real players, far less fun with dumbass traumatized bots.

pretty solid, reminiscent of old school COD Spec Ops in the way its co-op and you can replay missions trying to get the high score. Plays alot like a R6 Siege/Tarkov crossover.

weapon customization leaves something to be desired IMO.

certainly worthy of the sale price.



great tatical shooter, works well with controller great visuals, would recommend,

verry goood


So much potential but the AI makes zero sense. They can see through walls and are effectively all navy seal level shots. The amount of times I barely had a pixel of an enemy in view and got shot at is incredible, makes the game unplayable.

I also don't need a countdown time to initiate a mission, to start the mission and to end a mission. When i inevitably die in 3 seconds from an enemy i never saw, the last thing i want is an additional 5 minute wait before trying again. Total waste of money on this game.

buggy game. Enemies pop out of nowhere once cleared a scene. Same with the civilians, they randomly pops up making to too long to finish a missing coz team need to search endlessly.

very frustrating when you completed a whole mission (45 mins +) but have to abort because according to the game you havnt secured all sevillians very ducking frustrating go fucking fix this

looks great, plays well, levels change every time you play them which keeps it interesting.

shot a civilian on accident after 5 negligent discharges 10/10 game

My friend told me about this game and i am surprised how good of a tactical game this is . I mean i like the intense music in between Decent missions DlC worth buying but i am too broke for that but yea man Good Game

Insane, it has given me PTSD and I'm not even half way through the game.

needs email for mods
we are on steam why you dont have steam workshop.

crashes with the first recommendet mod , it was the only mod lol

Its good


I got to raid an average Steam user's apartment in the second mission, what's not to love?

Overall fun game. Need a pretty good GPU to get decent frames.

Its fun but not begginer friendly add more customization please

Most realistic police and swat game out there some of the missions send chills down your spine the attention to detail is unmatched

GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES NOW! "other guy shoots at you" ...AWWEE HELLLL NAAAWWWW... BOOM BOOM BOOM "other guy dead now"

Best Swat/Police sim money can buy. Incredible Game.

good

Fantastic gunplay and audio. Unfortunately the game gets boring very quickly because of lacking gamemodes. Its too repetitive and therefore not challenging enough. Overall I still recommend it and hope for more content.

Shot a man at point blank with a taser but it didn't work because he was in his reloading animation.

на колени на колени

This game is like Phasmophobia, but for boys and with guns.

Really fun game honestly , the only issue is a lot of people in the game seem to think its call of duty and they can just run around blasting everyone when its not that type of game at all. But if youre able to play with people that understand the style of game it is either on your friends list , in game or on the discord its a brilliant game

Dope graphics and gameplay. Gaming mechanics are next level. Definitely a top 10 game for 2024 for me.

Fantastic slow paced tactical shooter which ensured that i learned very quickly to check every nook and cranny.

i shot a black guy and he deserved it

i dont like thi game

Very Fun Game . People are friendly in this game (not like in cs or other games) and helpfull to be honest. Buy it when its on sale.

Friend walked forward when I was the first one in. Short version I shot him in the face. 10/10 game

cool game, tbh only really worth it when on sale but thats just my opinion

Rocking some terrorists shit in with a floral shirt.

can't be accused of war crimes if it technically isn't war

skipping CQB lessons for this one

If you liked Swat 3 back in the day, this is for you.

filthy fps

i love this game

insanely addicting 

public multiplayer is a nightmare though

This is what Rainbow Six Siege should have been.  Great details on all the gear, hope to see more variety of enemies in the future. Would Recommend.

Awesome game, lots of content to clear, tactics to use, and loadouts to try. The atmosphere is perfect and suits the missions well. It's also graphically soothing. The animations are fluid.
Theres a few nitpicks though. The AI can go from lemons to decepticons in milliseconds. You may fail getting S rank in a mission because some punk clotheslines you with a glock out of nowhere. Also, the pistols feel like nerf or nothin in some situations. A bald guy in suspenders shouldnt be tanking 14+ rounds of 45 acp in the chest without flinching even once.

very good

!!DROP YOUR WEAPON!!
!!PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!
!!DROP YOUR WEAPON!!
!!DROP YOUR WEAPON!!
!!PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!

Guns sound great and gameplay is fun while still challenging.

Game is super immersive. Makes me feel like an actual swat leader

this game is the greatest swat game ever its like swat 4 but better.I love swat 4 and ready or not

This game offers real life tactical insight of what officers such as  S.W.A.T  team may encounter on the job the game also provides a realistic feel and approach to guns weapons attachments and gadgets this game is amazing would like to see  a PVP aspect added to the game would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a slow and tactical and methodical approach to gaming best tactical shooter in my opinion by far

A day in the life of LA

it would be cool if this game wasnt so absurd in its handling of disturbing content. its cartoonish, the shit you see in this game. its pretending to be muh realism but its just sort of laughable 

heres your next mission, team- enter the home of Yimmy Bimmy, an infamous predator known for eating children's legs, but leaving them alive to be extra cruel. he has a shrine to honey boo boo in his home and the words "i love doing illegal things" are scribbled all over it.

gameplay wise the game is super solid and fun and all that. sucks that its chock full of AI generated slop though

gud gma

wild but fire

I've had this game for a bit, and by far, there is no other game that earns the Title of a Methodical and Precise Gameplay.

I, Honestly, started out just guns blazing and blowing through the maps completely unhinged cause I Thought that this was just another FPS game. I was extremely wrong. After looking at the Briefings, watching some videos, and actually looking at the setup for the scene's themselves, I realize that this game is more than just some first person shooter game that's meant to just be blowing people up and going in guns blazing, it's a game whether you think about the men behind you as well as the people in front of you, a game where you try to save the lives in front of you instead of killing them off for fun, a game that made me realize that the real world ain't right, but that's okay.

I haven't wrote a comment for another game while being on steam, at all. This is my first comment throughout my years of being on steam. I believe that people should know the shit they're about to get into when buying this game. This is a lovely yet world shattering game. It opens your eyes up to a whole new experience of gameplay, and I believe that it should be world renowned now. This game is the best I Have ever played, and I can't say that for any other game.

Word of advice to those that are scrolling the comments to see about purchasing this game. Don't go crazy and shoot up the map your on to save the good guys. You need to think methodical and save the perps as well as your own, and if you need to, take the life of those that deserve it. Save and Protect the people.

I love Ready or Not, because of the conent, soundtrack, DLCs, and lore.

goyslop

YES

good tactical shooter freaks me out sometimes just hear voices in the room next to you lol good game for a realistic shooter fan

What to say couse this is what i have been searching for since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with it's specific mission of springing an House of a Terrorists Cell. It's awesome, you are not here to kill you are here to arest the Suspects and civilians so they don't do something stupid. Honestly the only problem i have is that there are not enought non lethal guns and no non-lethal sidearms (yes there is a teaser but it's not a sidearm, it has a special equipment slot.). All in all an awesome TACTICAL Shooter simulation. If you were a fan of the old Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series (pre 2010 one) you could like this one very well.

Ready or Not is a tactical first-person shooter that offers an incredibly immersive and rewarding experience for fans of strategy and teamwork. Developed by VOID Interactive, the game captures the intensity and realism of law enforcement operations, blending methodical planning with high-stakes action.

From the moment you start, the game immerses you in its gritty, realistic world. The attention to detail in the environments and equipment is stunning, making every mission feel authentic. Whether you're breaching a suspect's hideout or clearing a hostage situation, the game’s atmosphere keeps you on edge, rewarding patience and strategy over run-and-gun tactics.

The core gameplay shines with its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Whether you’re playing solo with AI teammates or alongside friends in multiplayer, the coordination required to execute successful operations is deeply satisfying. The AI is surprisingly competent, providing solid support in single-player modes, while human teammates elevate the experience in multiplayer by bringing creativity and unpredictability to every mission.

The variety of missions and scenarios is impressive. From hostage rescues to high-risk warrant services, each mission offers unique challenges that require adaptability and critical thinking. The game doesn’t shy away from presenting morally complex situations, adding a layer of depth to the decision-making process.

Graphically, Ready or Not delivers a polished and realistic visual experience. The lighting, textures, and level design contribute to the tension and immersion, while the sound design amplifies the intensity with realistic weapon effects, environmental audio, and team communication.

What sets Ready or Not apart is its dedication to realism without sacrificing fun. The developers have struck a fine balance, creating a game that is both accessible to newcomers and challenging for hardcore tactical shooter fans. Regular updates and community feedback show VOID Interactive’s commitment to refining and expanding the game, which bodes well for its future.

If you're a fan of tactical shooters and cooperative gameplay, Ready or Not is a must-try. It offers an intense, engaging, and highly rewarding experience that’s perfect for players who enjoy thinking on their feet and working as part of a team. With its robust mechanics and immersive design, Ready or Not is a standout title in the tactical FPS genre.

AMAZING WORTH THE MONEY!

Can't launch game.

good.

Broken AI. They'll turn 180 degrees and one tap you from 100 yards away even if you haven't alerted anyone. They can see through walls and shoot through walls, even if you've just entered an area. Surrendering is broken. You can be point blank, and bash a terrorist with your muzzle a dozen times, and even though they've dropped their weapon, they wont get on their knees for you to cuff them. Broken hit reg. Point blank 357 to the chest 3 times with a laser? Nope. Nothing. Broken enemy spawns. I've had enemies spawn right in front of me as I'm arresting someone. I've also had enemies despawn right before my eyes. 
Also, enemies and civis can sprint, but I'm just here slowly sauntering through the world without a fuck to be had, but hey, at least I have the option to tiptoe at a snails pace that would make a 90 year old with a walker look like the flash. 
I keep trying to give this game a chance and they consistently disappoint.

Probably one of the best COOP games with friends

expect to die. very fast.

its really fun

The AI can be a little annoying at times but clearing rooms with the weapons and equipment provided by the game is very fun

Why are all the suspects black

Makes me feel like i'm useful.

i owe r6s an apology, this game is the epitome of dog shit

calm luh game

Apparently executing civilians is not allowed which doesn't make any sense to me

The game is amazing, it really is. The one thing i noticed however is that upon downloading this game again after a few months, the one key thing that i noticed was performance. I can’t even keep a stable 120 fps let alone a stable 90 fps without frames dropping every few seconds. Hope this eventually gets fixed. I had bought this game shortly after it had released and the performance was amazing, but now its all messed up.

I love the game concept, missions are well designed. Overall an excellent game for people who are done with games like COD and similar games. For my its a great story game with linear missions.  9/10 Just because you can't run in the game. At least temporary running could be in the game. Also the having to go back to planning to restart or re-do a mission. Too much time consuming if you want to restart a mission after making a mistake. It's realistic style but at the end of the day it's a game and time is money for casual gamers like me.

dope shi

farken good sh!t aye, grab it when it's on sale and shoot up some cracked cunt with the boyz, you'll have a good time m8 I'll tell you that much.

got stabbed by a local crackhead 10/10 experience

this game makes me want to kill pedophiles and innocent civilians in cold blood

The game is well done, it has been done with talent. However, it's extremely shallow and looks like a cheap copy of Swat 4 (not cheap actually, it costs a lot and it's not even worth half it's price). The only difference that Swat 4 was great for its time and it could be considered a complete game. Ready or Not does not add or improve anything of it, and remains limited and with lack of content in an era where adding such things is not just possible but easier. Maybe a PVP mode where players could play as criminals and cops COULD save this game and make it fun. If you do one day, I would buy it. For now, I don't think it's worth it.

Intense.  Big Fun

After getting S on all the missions I highly recommend to not do it.

Best game ever (´ε｀；)

lame

fun game

uyighujghjgh

uh sigma sigma uh sigma sigma? sigma sigma sigma SIGMA!


👍

super fun

.

Probably one of the best tactical shooters available

1 - Seleciono o mapa e fico animado para jogar
2 - Carrega o mapa e chego perto da porta do local
3 - Abro a porta e sou fuzilado em 1 segundo
4 - morro e ganho um F
5 - Faço a mesma coisa mas presto atenção agora na porta
6 - Nada acontece, abaixo a guarda e um louco avança e me mata dnv
GOTY

Fun game but bots can basically smell you and plant a headshot in .01 seconds from 200yds away. Biggest gripe is having to constantly open and close the game any time a mission fails so half my team doesn't have to go to therapy because Miguel got aimbotted in through a keyhole

Amazing to play with homies. Too much fun actually. Thank you devs for putting out content/updating and optimising the game. It's been running great.

Nice Game, nice story!

love it wish weapons more customizable

my friend watched me die cause she thought it would be a good idea to "be humane" and "ethical" by bringing a non-lethal shotgun. this has made me realise police brutality is a good thing

Great tactical FPS

good

great game all  around good combat

Amazing game. Tactical and slow. A change of speed

Good game. Realistic. Tactical.  Dumbass AI teammates.

The briefing room has a working vending machine! 10/10 always recommend.

 Seriously though, it is great solo, great multiplayer, and fully detailed customisation for load out and character. The game play is quick, diverse and engaging. I used to play Siege, but never again, with this game being better in every way. Even better for those that care, they care about the team and you can tell the developers love this project. I would even say this game is realistic, but I am not swat or american :\.

opened a front door and exploded to a trip mine

OBJECTIVE COMPLETE (BRING ORDER TO CHAOS) pops up, instant relax.

Great game.

gud, has guns

light glitch so bad in the office and second level that it makes for a horrid experience

EVERYTHING IS GOOD BUT THERE IS NO SNIPER MISSION

I can even load into the game i have spent the last 3 hours watching countless YouTube videos and scrolling through Reddit posts looking for solutions and cant past the first loading screen with out crashing.

I have been playing for awhile and started to realize how long it took my game to load. Until one day my game went black at startup. I thought it was gonna take awhile again but instead popped up the message corrupt data confirm your purchase, I don't know how to fix it and am now mad because i spent good money on this game and now it wont even work. But in the times i played this it was very fun.

They failed to realize that they're dealing with Spetsnaz.

Just stupid ass AI your team about a smart as a smooth avocado but the enemy AI is john wick. AI needs a ungodly amount of work. The level designs are shitty along with the "campaign" just tacked on along with the stress management components. To top it off instead of fixing these issues lets drop two DLCs instead of fixing the glaring issues of the base game.

very fun solo or with friends

Gives you a healthy respect for swat, and a simmering hatred of civilians

One of the best realism games, this games story is amazing and the little features and details make it one of the best.

mODS ARE BU*GGED

very fun love killing my friends as a joke then start a war

Fucking ass, it crashed 5 times in 30 minutes and 25 of the 30 minutes was it freezing, i tried dx11, dx12, and safe mode, same mode worked for about 3 minutes and when i tried to fire my gun it crashed.

cool

Strife, Grog, and Bionic Tuna are experiencing immense FOMO by not owning this game. I feel bad that they feel bad.

WE NEED MORE CS GAS IN THE ROOM WITH ONE SUSPECT

Horribly optimised, buggy key assignment in options. Game is fun but having to spend 20 minutes and changing keyboard just to play the game is bullshit.

This game is so hard to put into a review, the gameplay and graphics are perfect, its both realistic and serious so i enjoy it, the setting being LS is awsome, kinda feels like youre a cop in gta v, some of the missions takle some super serious topics that hapen daily and is very dificult to just look past, especially the 18th birthday and the collage missions, but this is deffinatley the best cop game ever, 911/12

good game

A brutal game, but one the best realistic shooters I've ever played



i dont think this is entirely fair that the ai can bum rush you to the point you can fire because theyre so close but they can still mag dump you, other than that the game is alright.

Stressed? Load up Valley of the Dolls with a shotgun.

Such a fun game!

Game is amazing

rammed into the household of narco addicts with 4 friends, starting shooting anything that is nearly humanoid, shot a mother of a little girl on her eyes, came back home, played ready or not, 10/10

STOP RESISTING!!

really fun

Brilliant game, great atmosphere, visuals, lighting and sound are amazing. Unlike a lot of games in this genre it actually runs really well, Ai is nicely tuned these days. a great balance of hard and unpredictable it really puts you on edge a lot of the time. If you like realistic shooters this is a must. Me and a mate have been doing a Ironman play which has been really fun. (try do all the maps in series without dying) it really adds a lot of extra jeopardy because we really don't want to die.

Amazing game. 9/10, i love the movement and tactical features included in this game. It truly is amazing, would reccomend.

it is a fun game

good game fr

Not bad

pepper ball pistol?

My legit only complain about this game is the non-stealth. Enemies will see you through fractions of pixels and know when you're behind them. Otherwise incredible shooter.

I wasn't ready. 10/10

Good game

Poor enemy AI

As a former Para... this thing is awesome. Great gunplay, thrilling story told in an interesting way, love the attention to detail, dope in coop and a good update frequency.
Great effort, VOID keep the good work up. This game will stay relevant for a long time in this genre.

very immersive and can get addictive to finish the tasks

For steam deck users, Ready or not has controls for the steam deck but without changing settings you will get around 25-35fps and it can dip below 5. Still a great game.

Overall: fun gunplay, but I recommend some gunfighter mods because the recoil is too high IMHO.
AI behavior is getting better with every patch. Great graphics and audio. Immersing experience with great balance between ,,simulator,, (ARMA etc.) and run and gun games like CoD.
Multiplayer: Fun, immersing if u want and u will feel the need for communication in your squad. Simply amazing. Sometimes long loading as only negative
Singleplayer: I enjoy the gameplay and details about being a leader. But I hate the fact that officers are more stressed from killing a pedophile then from their squadmate being injured.

Summation: Amazing immersive CQB tactical shooter that u enjoy better with friends. 8.5/10

very good

peak

Last update has made the game unplayable. Tripwires and traps are invisible and my friends save file has been completely wiped. And as per usual right before the holidays when everyone goes on vacation.

I mean it's alright I suppose.

good


First level in a guy taking a shit shot me with a shotgun so I reflexively shot him in the balls and handcuffed his lifeless body. I gained experience for collecting evidence doing this. 10/10 won't open a bathroom door again. 

Good game.

Hit reg, is a joke. :)

badass game

just buy it

all the fun without the paperwork
10/10

I get to shoot people. So good game 👍

I killed civilians and got an F. Just like grade school.

Got it as a gift

Shot a family of 4, then hopped on ready or not.

great game, super fun

그저 갓겜

Fun game but the system 'RECOMMENDED' specs are bs.
I basically am forced to use DLSS on a RTX4060.
Couldn't imagine how bad it would be on a  1060.

super fun makes me feel like a swat member

It's a good game, but it has AI art.
/s

Very cool Game ,but i played the same level 3 time and couldn't find all the subject and on the third try ,2 of my swat officers got stuck got stuck in a cave. I don't know if i try it another time. For the Game creators add something that you can see the last subject or civils through the walls ,after a very long time

awesome

very good game, great for serious co-op but also really funny if you start messing about

I've been a cop for about 10 years. I've never done SWAT at my Department, but for most situations involving things that require a tactical unit, we have the tools usually necessary to go in as patrol officers and I'm very much impressed by the realism here.  The scenarios and situations introduced are legitimate scenarios that SWAT teams and police will unfortunately encounter. So many police games either too over-the-top, use of force isn't scrutinized, and probable cause and other legal terms aren't recognized, but this game really seemed to get it right. There's too many cop games that have no idea how law enforcement actually works, but in this case, the dev team must've had good help behind the scenes from real world law enforcement. Thanks for not shying away from the more "triggering" scenarios, because even though they might be triggering, it's just the real world and what cops have to see and deal with in their line of work.

games pretty good but every single mission without fail i get my legs literally like shot off. broken. and the problem is that it reminds me of when neighbro tom hit me with his car and it makes me really sad

Currently cannot recommend this game in the slightest. I was expecting that after several YEARS in early access, the developers of this game would have been smart enough to optimize their game's core systems, rather than simply layering more barely-usable content on, alas, we are where we are. 

Suspect AI is simultaneously oddly efficient and horribly incompetent. I have had DOZENS of scenarios where a suspect will acknowledge my presence, yell several voice lines of engaging me or my AI teammates, and simply stand in place with their gun at a low ready. When the AI does work, most of the time it ends up firing precisely at you through multiple surfaces, even after breaking contact through walls. They will often sprint while shooting, which does not seem to reduce their accuracy at all. What's even odder about this is that the suspects are stupidly easy to deal with! Often it is possible to surprise them, even if you've just exploded a door one single room over, they seem to do very little damage, and they are very simply just Not Smart. It doesn't feel like a desperate person robbing a store, or highly trained assassins anymore, the suspects feel like Suspect AI that are often just robotic and confusing.

What I find fascinating is the devblogs showing us multiple "cool new things" the suspect AI can do. They can sneak around you, pick up weapons that have been dropped, kill themselves when at critical morale, set traps, prepare ambushes, try to stab you with a knife if surrendered, squeeze through small gaps, hide under beds and in closets, all kinds of interesting ideas. However, THEY NEVER ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THESE. In about 60 hours of playtime after the largest "suspect overhaul", I have never seen a suspect kill themselves, hide, flank, or anything of the sort. The primary behavior I see is AI behaving like ChatGPT attached to a camera, before becoming an Ultrakill character and sprinting at maximum velocity while shooting.

Friendly AI also suffers this odd hybrid issue of being incredibly broken and incredibly cracked as well, though. Often the friendly AI gets confused and fully locks up on doorways, hallways, stairs, attempting to arrest people, or even just on a simple lip of a hallway. They sometimes will run off in an absolutely inane fashion upon being told to search a single room, often getting killed running of on their own. They often ignore contacts and will be killed like lemmings if an order is issued that for some reason prevents them from moving while engaging. The friendly AI is also incapable of dealing with hostage situations, and will in my experience, 100% of the time reliably gun down both the civilian and suspect. 
HOWEVER. When the AI DOES finally work, they are incredibly efficient and accurate*, and are actually somewhat enjoyable to interact with, until they stand in a door paralyzed again. 

*(They hit 30% of the shots they take. Suspect AI lands about 50% and is usually much more willing to open fire and move away.)

Currently, the game just exhausts me. It used to be an enjoyable experience. The suspect AI was actually quite reactive and tough to deal with in earlier versions, a few years ago, which I found enjoyable. There were multiple scenario options for each map, like bomb threats or raids with incredibly aggressive AI that you were allowed to kill on sight. The mission UI on the board in the station even has this system left in it! The "Barricaded Suspects" text on every single mission is completely vestigial from this time, as barricaded suspects used to be the default and easiest scenario! 

Overall, the game is just.... Sad.

The thick environment, grime, suspense, that it claims to inherit from SWAT 4 are gone. Sometimes it shines through in the subtle soundtrack of a rainy map, or the way a room is lit, but the issues with the game are inexcusable and have been built so far into the game's very core it will be impossible for it to recover. 

Ready or Not has not found it's identity. It flip-flops between being a realistic police simulator in text, while hinting at government conspiracy with it's gameplay and lore, but when you play the game its essentially just a game about surprising unengaging AI in various ways in a sandbox with a very small layer of story and polish put into it.
The story is simply not present outside of what are essentially the Arkham City audio logs and some admittedly okay environmental setup. The gameplay is frustrating, uninteresting, and unintuitive. The environment and world is occasionally a bright spot, before another ragdolled dead civilian turns into spaghetti through half the map again. The tone I get from this game is raw confusion and disinterest.

I hate to discuss motivations, but I really don't think the developers care very much about this game anymore. I think they've built something on a sandy foundation that they knew would collapse, but are far too deep in to fully fix anymore. The priority seems to be on selling new DLC content, which I can understand from a small team that needs funds, however this game has been such a runaway success that I'm really not sure where that money is going. I KNOW the developers are smart enough to fix these issues, I KNOW they CAN do it, because they've done it in the past, and they've made some genuinely interesting systems for the AI, so I'm left to conclude that they either simply do not care enough, or the people who made those awesome things are not working anymore.

Simply, this is not SWAT 5. Los Suenos is deader than an actual Exxon gas station in the middle of nowhere. While some missions successfully capture the tone of the SWAT series, if only for a second, it loses it in the next. 

Heavy topics such as human trafficking, acts of mass violence, systemic societal deficiencies, immigration, drug production, sexual abuse of minors, and even MKUltra are touched on, but no more than simply at a surface level of "Hey look, aren't we cool for showing this." The game comes across as entirely an entirely surface-level, COD MWII No Russian-level of engagement with policing. It seems like shock value, marketing, buzzwords, not actual storytelling.

This is, at it's core, a sandbox, and a very small, uninteresting one at that. There are, at least on paper, several interesting parts to this game. None of them work. If one eventually does work for you, it will be at about halfway capacity. Even without the issues, the game at it's core is just bland. It's lost the SWAT spirit of highly atmospheric maps. The color grading is awful. The suspects aren't engaging. The environments can be pretty to look at, but they aren't characters themselves like they were in SWAT 4. Teammate AI is randomized, and often has exactly one unique line of dialogue per mission. Everything is just kind of off, and overall, this is categorically one of the most loosely designed, balanced, and conceived games I have ever seen. 

I'll probably keep playing for nostalgia and for the occasion my friends decide to play, but this game is not worth any price above five dollars. I am sorry, VOID, but you've really let me down. I was betting on you for quite a while, but you've absolutely failed to deliver a product marketable as anything close to a SWAT sequel, let alone a product worth FIFTY US Dollars.






If you wanna see something more interesting than this game, go to literally any grimy, dirty, weird gas station at like 8pm in the winter. Literally any one. Gets across the vibe this game was trying for significantly better than VOID did.

I really need to learn how to trigger discipline myself from shooting civilians in the face when they verbally insults me or pulling phone on me. 10/10 experience

I don't even know. This game has changed so much over the course of it's early access development and supposed 1.0 and thereafter. I don't think the game is bad. I think it's in a worse place than it could be. And I also think it won't return to it's peak. 

It sure is a spiritual successor to SWAT 4. So it succeeds there. But everything is super rough. The controls can be odd, gunplay can feel unfair, AI on both sides is so fucking inconsistent, and worst of all it isn't very well optimized. It's difficult to even give this a thumbs down with all the time and fun I've had with it. But I am not going to tell people to buy this one.

I think the primary issue is the devs. They constantly pendulum swing between updates as to whether the game runs better and as to whether the AI is any good. And ever since 1.0 they release like 2 updates a year, focusing on DLC, and not really tackling the primary issues with the game. I think both the AI and the performance have both gotten to a point that has finally made me uninstall and that's without even trying any new maps from DLC 2. Because I just couldn't bring myself to try new stuff when the old maps still aren't up to snuff in terms of AI pathing, suspect behaviour, and again the performance is painful no matter what I do to the graphics.

Right, so....don't get me wrong, I like this game, but I got my fair share of beef with how this game is handled.... and it all mainly revolves around the suspects, the environments/enemy types.....versus your own AI teammates/friends

Starting off small, there are ALOT of times where im thinking "wtf were the devs thinking?"
and the first time this happened was in the Mindjot mission... the security for this ISP makes no sense whatsoever. yes, the company got involved in some bad stuff, but im pretty sure those punk kids you hired off the street and gave shiny uniforms, and guns aren't willing to actually get into a firefight with a teir - 1 SWAT team, especially given what the company is involved in. chances are they're just there for the paycheck, and its most likely not a big enough paycheck to risk death over.
besides that....Fleekazoid put it best in his review of this game as to how notoriously bad the AI is (albeit he pointed to it as a positive XD)
"whatever jaded crystals these guys are on has them shooting you through three walls if they so much as feel your AURA in the building", yet the devs make it so you are punished for going with the "shoot first, ask questions later" approach.
like, pick which side of the fence your on already, especially with these animations updates. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW:

-suspect SEE'S me, responds verbally, but slowly starts raising their gun at me, refuses to back down after being threatened by MY WHOLE TEAM..AND I'M STILL PUNISHED FOR DROPPING HIM????

-when breaching a room, the AI automatically prioritize YOU as a target every single time despite.....from the enemies perspective, there isn't anything special about you. Yes, this still happens even IF you were the last person to enter, or you just hang out outside the room while your team clears it. like there is no winning with this AI because unless you drop them first, YOU WILL be seeing "Hold F to stop Bleeding" more than actually working on the objectives, or literally anything else. there is even a chance this could happen when the team breaches ACROSS THE MAP, granted the enemy can't hit you through so many surfaces in this case, but this just feels absurd, aggravating even.

- another ridiculous thing is how the AI is able to see you in some cases. at complete random you WILL start getting shot at, and you will not be able to accurately determine which way you're being shot at from as having one round pass by you reduces your aim to room temperature ice, and even when you DO find the perp on perks, they....

- will tank whole magazines if your caliber is lower than 5.56mm if that NPC has a vest that looks like they got it from Ebay, or TEMU. they won't even FLINCH, and in many cases if they're using the same caliber as you....( lets use 9mm in this case )
their bullets feel like they could be one shot head shot. where as yours feel like you just hurt their feelings.

-if the perp takes 17 shots, and collapses, never assume they're dead because they could still get back up to not surrender for a SECOND time; this is forgivable to a degree as many times the positions these NPC's collapse in often don't leave you with any ability to cuff them without risking yourself by creeping into the suspects sights. this could be fixed by giving me the option to drag them by an arm/leg behind cover, thus reducing risk.

- somehow shooting the ground near the suspects feet A: still wounds them, and B: still counts against your score... this is just unfortunate as the AI sometimes get stuck in an animation, and doing this in my experience is an effective way to override the animation lock. like using new code to override old code; this is helpful especially around bigger hallways where its important to keep your primary out in case some rando with a gat rears the corner so you can keep em from squad wiping everyone. I know there are non-lethal options but A: you can still catch these demerits for using them like you were using bullets, and the taser just means "oh i just used 1 of my 2 shots to detain one person" ....in a building with WHO KNOWS how many suspects.

- without any lights, NVG's, or any way to actually see into extremely dark area's, will still shoot you through three walls...


and so far im only mentioning the enemies, but your AI  TEAMMATES will annoy you even FURTHER by:

- having they're nav-mesh glitch consistently around stairs, forcing you to assume the lead, and putting you at risk because your team forgot how stairs work

-if you are engaged in a firefight, and your team isn't tasked with anything, then your AI team will WALK INTO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT WHILE YOU ARE FIRING, just to do what you were already doing: handling a hostile situation, this could be negated by taking away friendly fire penalties for AI teammates (when within 3 feet) unless said friendly fire results in death, but I still get why its a feature....

-sometimes the AI squad will lock eyes with a wall, and IGNORE ALL SENSORY INPUT, yes including getting shot at, or shived. (was able to determine the AI was locking onto a perp making noise in an adjacent room, but gets stuck as it doesn't have a line of sight)

-the new helicopter observer helps, but with no way to direct the cameraman, then it makes using the helicopter needlessly tedious. if the camera guy is too far zoomed in on IR, I can't feasibly tell where that random perp IS, so please include a command for that, or to at least acknowledge the sighting with "Noted, keep scanning for more" so the heli doesn't lock eyes on that perp like spongebob watches his flowers XD

- in bigger rooms, you pretty much HAVE to order ALL FOUR MEMBERS to clear it as they WILL pull a scooby doo, and go "LET'S SPLIT UP GANG" without you to hold their hands, and when more than 7ft apart, somehow AI teammates is somehow dumber than patrick star with a board in his head, because they also become slow to respond to ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER.

when the AI is this bad, it can greatly diminish the dark beauty that is the greater story of los suenos, and its silent commentary because, and just to borrow a quote from fleek on this, but you'll be forced to even "Make your non lethal shotgun lethal, wake up before you get put to sleep"

looks, sounds. story, I can't complain; I like where the devs are going, but they NEED to pay more attention to the AI, and one other feature...you thought I was done? NAAAAAAAW!

Last major gripe i have towards this game is its reliance on Mod.Io

Mod.Io for Ready or Not....its NOT XD
Insurgency sandstorms Mod.Io port is way more stable than Ready or Not's

Ready or Not's mod support will AUTOMATICALLY redownload mods you TRY to get rid of, be it  through the menu, deleting the mod files, uninstall through Mod.Io, it is SAVED onto Ready or Not, and when it can't reinstall the files it "Redownloads" WILL become corrupt making any boot up option outside of "No mods" WILL crash the game before it can boot up. so PLEASE.... GET. RID. OF. THE. CURRENT. PORT. for Mod.Io as it's clearly broken beyond use

for those that think "no problem, i'll just use Nexus"..... I wish you good luck, because nothing works on that end either, I've tried....overall I've given up on the cosmetic/audio mods I want to use because of how UNSTABLE modding can be for THIS game.

At least Insurgency Sandstorms Mod.Io support is able stable enough to actually work, contact their develop team, and try to figure out how they made that thing work, because from what I gather: Mod.Io has a pretty bad rep when it comes to the modding community. In this game, that BS just doesn't want to work properly, and i'd highly recommend just removing it from the game entirely as the whole point of a mod manager/workshop is to make my modding experience easier, not harder.

I see the passion in the project, but with these flaws, I can't give this game a thumbs up, even though I enjoy everything else...i'll edit when next update comes out, and see if these get fixed

>Check 15 doors for traps
>No traps on any of those
>Open 1 door without checking
>Get blown up by a tripwire bomb
Now I even check my bedroom door for traps

Since of the addition of DLCs it seems you cannot mod the game if you don´t buy them because you cannot use older mods and neither the new ones since they are only updated to DLCs, pretty much making it a subscription if you want to use mods and destroying the story.

I bought this game a long time ago and i have been a big fan of the project but this is just greedy. I realize that the development team behind this masterpiece is small but the fact that there haven´t been any major free updates since the release of 1.0 it´s fair to say there won´t be any more free updates, just paid content. 

The game is honestly amazing and i don´t really care about a few DLC maps and cosmetics but the loss of mods really hurts and that´s why i am leaving a negative review. 

It was great while it lasted.

Released out of early access in a rush to be able to charge for the "DLC" The game was not ready and super buggy. This is the last early access I will ever play or try to play because its always the same trash. Pay us for unfinished work so we can start working on our second version of the game we will make you pay $70 for. Oh and all the DLC you will be buying. Early access is starting to feel like the biggest scam of our time. Polish nothing, finish nothing, open cash shop asap, kick out dlc for unfinished game. I love this new trend!

A good game with a great gun shooting experience, but when to train the police officers to use LPVO and increase the number of recruited police officers

Ready or Not is the equivalent to the most immersive, yet toxic ex-partner that you hate to love... (I know that sentence makes no sense; just go with it.)

Ready or Not is such a ridiculously immersive game, especially when played without the HUD. It puts you in the shoes of what is essentially a SWAT team leader, as you clear everything from crackdens, mansions, yachts, hospitals, and more, with every single location bringing a completely new setting and set of challenges to the table... In theory...

While I absolutely recommend RoN if you're into slow-paced room-clearing games, in its current state, the immersion I was talking about previously hangs on by the smallest of threads. The game doesn't have any difficulty settings, so while I believe the game is much better now than it was at release (back then enemies were pinpoint accurate headshot machines), you quickly see that with even the most basic understanding of the maps and heavy armour equipped, all semblance of difficulty is quickly lost. 

What is supposed to be a slow, methodical game about clearing rooms can quickly turn into a run-and-gun fest when you get even remotely comfortable with the mechanics. With heavy armour, you essentially become a walking tank, and as long as you don't literally reload your gun in the face of an enemy wielding a shotgun, you should be good. Luckily, you can pretty easily nerf yourself by putting on light armour, a stab vest, or even going in with no armour, but there's no reason to do that, because the 11 (currently glitched) slots the game provides are more than enough for literally every map.

With every major update / paid DLC, the developers add in stuff for free. Whether that's new guns, bug-fixes, AI updates, or balance changes. Yet with each such update, there's usually a bunch of new bugs that rear their ugly head, demolishing the immersion. Even if I ignore the fact that my AI squadmate got stuck in a wardrobe in the Lawmaker mission, the fact that the developers added new surrender animations that see the enemies literally pointing the muzzle of their gun at your head, yet you losing points if you shoot them in that animation, and even some of the slowest, most boring surrender animations known to man, none of that tops the fact that currently you can be arresting a suspect, walk out of that animation without fully arresting them, and for that specific suspect to become impossible to arrest. In a game about arresting people, doing that might trigger a glitch that forces you to either restart (trying to S rank) or incapacitate / kill the suspect.

And that's just it. Would I recommend this game? Yes. Do I think it has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic game? Yes. Am I hooked on just how blood-pumping the experience can be? Yes. But do I also return every now and then, enjoy the experience, yet become frustrated and disappointed that nothing much has really changed? Yes.

Just like that biznatch of an ex!

7/10

A very slow tactical shooter, SWAT simulator, with heavy and uncensored undertones.
Gunplay/ballistics is top notch.

10/10


TL;DR: Columbine sim

Amazing experience playing this game. Much respect to devs, true labour of love. Thank you for constantly updating and adding content to the game :)

Campaign needs an overhaul
 - once you go down you take control of one of the bots
 - get rid of the stress levels, or just tone down the aggressiveness of how drastic peoples attitudes change.
The play hit boxes need to be fixed in general, many times have I shot someones arm or leg and it doesn't register until I mag dump.
Make the SWAT '99 outfit challenge more descriptive, because I beat all of the levels in the main campaign with friends thinking I would be done.  Yet here I am going through all of them again in order to get the outfit.

This is only negative because these factors bring down the game 20 pegs.  The story telling in the environment are perfect.  Also just because the game isn't fun because of the factors I have listed above doesn't make the game realistic.  It just means that this takes up space in my steam library.  Some things just need to be changed in order to make the game a video game.  I'm not playing this because I want a super hyper realistic SWAT simulator.  I am playing this because this game has some of the best gunplay out there and R6 isn't exactly what it used to be.

Brutal, mature and scary. 
You got cool guns, dismemberment, flexible tactics that make even the most simple missions endlessly replayable and aggressive firefights with lowlifes that act unpredictably and erratically; just like real life.

Ready Or Not, Space Marine 2 are the games we NEED.

Immersive, intense, haunting, brutal. Witnessed a child overdose in a meth house shortly before dodging a drug fueled knife attack around the next corner. This game is heavy.

Place C4 explosives on door
Detonate the C4
2 Civilians die painfully
Look in the room
See suspect with shotgun
Mag dumps them 3 times
T-Bags them
Loses an officer whilst doing so 
Tossed a grenade into a childs room
shot a civilian to death
lost my job
Went home and played ready or not
10/10 would do it again

i really enjoyed this, it's different than just killing and shooting.. it's more satisfying getting people down to surrender than to out right kill them.  I did get this game gifted to me by friend as they needed more players and I'm glad to join in.

RoN is a very good game. Love game. Very good. Give more gun plz


This game hits the nostalgia of Swat 4, but the Commander mode adds in the right amount of mechanics to make this the best modern take on that tactical gameplay loop

this game is incredible, one the best realism shooters out there. If you like the aspect of playing as a SWAT operative, get this game now, you will not regret it

This SWAT-inspired FPS delivers a fun and intense experience, striking a balance between rewarding teamwork and punishing mistakes. It's reasonably priced, features satisfying gunplay, and boasts strong developer support that continues to improve the game.

The graphics are impressive, though there's still room for refinement, especially with civilian NPC behavior, which can feel inconsistent at times. Enemies are ruthless, making every encounter a test of strategy and reflexes. The single-player mode cranks up the difficulty even further, providing a brutal but rewarding challenge.

The game doesn't shy away from sensitive and graphic topics, handling them with a level of respect that enhances its impact. While this may not be for everyone, it adds to the realism and intensity.

Playing with friends is where this game truly shines, offering unforgettable tactical moments and edge-of-your-seat action. It's a work in progress, but one that has already won my admiration.

Game is cool and all.
But there is constant crashes which makes it completely unplayable.

It's good. That's all. You should probably play it. (If you like these kind of games of course.)

Still way too buggy to have had a 1.0 release.

this game is the perfect SWAT game all of the gamers have been waiting for. its simply perfect its great the graphics are great even on low settings and the stories feel really real if you are looking for a shooter game where you play as a SWAT officer and go into situations like hostage situations and shootings this is the perfect game for you

Salty price for base game, but it's alright when on sale. I've had a lot of fun playing with my friends and trying to get the best rating. However, every new content will have a price tag (DLCs, no more great updates apparently) and some AI features are only available in DLC maps (but they could be in the base game - some other reviews commented about this).
This brings me a feeling that the base game will not be updated with new content anytime soon.

I sometimes forget the powerful devesation that is a shotgun so when I fired on one target I saw his face blown off and the other had his arm blown off. So when I went to restrain my brain didn't think for a split second untill I realised that you can't restrain a 1 armed dead guy. Headless man could and he decided to bounce down the stairs behind me. 
666/10 would doom guy my way through gas station again.

The game is absolutely amazing. One of the best hardcore tactical shooters out there. Very unforgiving, doesn't hold your hand.

Although It's an amazing game that does live up to expectations as a tactical, first-person shooter - It could benefit from refinement.

To start :

- Optimization in singleplayer is very lackluster, with cases of performance varying between systems rather than hardware specificiations. I have an RTX 3060 12GB, 16GB DDR4 RAM, i5-11400F. Considering the games RECOMMENDED requirements are a GTX 1060 6GB, my system should work wonders, no? Wrong. On singleplayer, SPECIFICALLY after the most recent updates, my fps has significantly tanked. During the Home Invasion update I was running at 90-140fps singleplayer. Varied based off of the map. Now? Can hardly push 40-60fps on most of the maps, even with my settings set to the lowest. Reason why? GPU Usage is incredibly low (~40-60%) for no reason. Improper utilization of hardware. Not pushing my rig to its limit. Though, for someone else with the same rig as me - they might have absolutely fantastic performance. It varies.

-Multiplayer fixes some of the performance issues, at the expense of losing out on game progression and AI Teammates supporting you (or making your run significantly harder). 

- making the AI less superhuman - less penalizing if you accidentally blow their brains out. I don't like peaking a corner and then being greeted with a jumpscare :)

- more customization options ; cosmetics, weapons, weapon attachments, maybe weapon styles in the same way where you can apply clothing styles? giving some weapons a black / tan variant, camo variant, etc etc.

Speaking of AI and Progression - the progression system is also quite nice. Unlocking cosmetics and other things alike based off of your performance in-game is a pretty rewarding system for if you do amazing, but also a very harsh system if you do absolutely horrible. You can't get caught slacking in this game like you could be on others - you get domed? you restart. you're not coming back from that.

Gunplay and mechanics are very impressive and smooth, though I'd recommend for anyone trying to get the upper edge when playing to replace your crouch keybind with freelean. Wider radius of angles and you can peak a bit overhead too.

Multiplayer was very interesting the few times that I had played it with friends. Sometimes it worked - sometimes it didn't. Again, it varied a lot, for some reason.

Overall - 10/10 game. Does it deserve a buy? I'd say yes, but only when it's on sale. For $50 I'd expect a game like this to arrive with both DLC, but I guess not. Buy it when it's on sale - and don't buy it standalone. Buy the Home Invasion Bundle or the LSPD Bundle. For lovers of games like Ground Branch, R6, Six Days in Fallujah, etc etc - you'll love this game.



Really enjoy the game but I think the DLC is a little overpriced given what you get... No offense but I purchased the game that was already quite short to begin with given the amount you can do no safe house, lackluster weapon customization, very little skins, to say I got burnt out quick is an understatement. Lots of potential but very little execution in my opinion. Purchase the entirety on a sale possibly and its well worth it. Base game + the DLC whenever it releases adds up quickly though.

every mission is 20 minutes of tactical goodness, strategy, drippy gear, cool guns. Become a strategic mastermind just for everytime that there's 1 suspect left they become a demon who rushes corners and 1 taps you. 9/10 took down CP criminal rig while blasting deftones.

Yelled "POLICE, GET DOWN!" at suspects. They didn't get down. Got clapped by crackhead with shotgun behind door. Team rated my leadership 2/10.
10/10 most realistic door-opening simulator ever made

So uh the AI team members are pretty good however anytime a hostage thing happens they shot the civ and the one time I accidently killed a civ being used as a shield some how I got lit up from the front by one guy and from behind by four... wonder how (Why did you make them kill you for accidently hitting a civ)

Update: The AI team members also murder people who are stunned from gas or bean bag as the guy is going to shoot once the stun is over despite them clearly still being stunned this was a bug before but it was not that big of a issue as they would put their hands up while stunned but now I have to stop and beat up a guy for 30 sec every time as they now only put their hands up after the stun is over which is not very fun

Good tactical shooter.  Let's ya get that experience being a cop/swat without lowering your morals and actually becoming a cop/swat.

There's a mod which allows you to shoot civilians as much as you want.

play with friends or you'll loose your damn mind, other then that the games fun af. If you do play solo dont play for to long or you'll burn yourself out.


My feelings on the base game are positive and I do highly recommend the game. 
However, this game still feels like early access, it still feels unfinished.
The latest DLC even intensifies that feeling. While the maps are truly stunning and are fun to play, they are empty. 
Simply as. You don't get a narrative nor characters or any story beats aside from the mission briefing and some minor (Easily-Missable) Banter with your squad, and this hurts the game and ruins any replayability. Void Interactive are incredibly talented development team especially due to its small size. These DLCs felt like they needed a narrative, an actual narrative one with dialogue and villains and a continuing storyline that isn't hiding in the background. Yet there is nothing of such here. You can do plenty with environmental storytelling, but you can also think you're doing something with it only to realise that you have told a nothing burger for your customers (Scorn).    
We need characters on every mission that would explain to us what is happening what are they feeling and what they think about the faction we are fighting. 

Right now we just have maps that represent a WHAT IF scenario for us to play around with. I have almost 69 (nice) hours on this game. Most of it is from redoing the mission in an attempt to S-rank it. But after I do I have nothing to fall on. 
While you may argue that "you played for 69 hours, I think you can say that this game is highly playable". Well, to that I say that those hours were accumulated during the start of the early access launch Which launched 3 years ago. Aside from the bare-bones multiplayer side and the singleplayer "commander" mode side. There isn't anything of massive substance yet. I truly believe that if this game would have a visible narrative one that isn't strictly environmental it would raise the bar and would truly solidify the game into being worthy of 1.0. 

TLDR: The base game is amazing. The game still feels unfinished and early access.

This game is pretty great and has given us the SWAT sequel we deserved. It's an excellent, gritty experience that succeeds in making a thrilling and often uncomfortable experience.  

I do have some complaints. For starters, I understand the idea of using the police station as a navigable level for you to set up the game for you and your other officers. But there's just so many things that don't make sense. 

It's very slow to load, even on an SSD. And you will have to load in and out of this level every time you start and end a mission. 

If you are playing single player and die or want to restart, the only way to do so is to return to this level, then load back into the level where you died. There is a retry button in multiplayer lobbies, but not for singleplayer, which sort of discredits the argument that this is the developers way of saying "You don't get second chances in real life.".  I think it's more likely just a design oversight. 

In a recent update, suspects seem to no longer surrender without beating them to comply. Before that was a relatively rare possibility, but now it seems to be vastly increased. Beanbag rounds and other less-lethal seem to be even more ineffective than they used to be. 

I'm obviously not intimately familiar with police protocol, but as far as I understand if you are refusing to comply, while holding/waving an automatic weapon in close proximity to police, saying "I'm going to kill you", you will be shot. However, even after giving people like this 10-15 seconds to comply, shooting them, even with less lethal such as a beanbag gun, will result in a penalty for excessive force. I've also shot the weapon out of the suspect's hand, or watched them go to surrender, only for an AI teammate to blow their brains out, with no penalty. Again, this is just after the latest update. Before it seemed to work a lot more believably.

Which brings me back to the management/police station. In Singleplayer after every mission you get informed how your fellow officers are doing. Do badly or make them do too many scary things like breaching, they'll get stressed. They can die or quit, etc. Sort of like XCOM. I've probably played 20 hours of the game since this update, and I still have no idea what it actually does, as I'm yet to notice an effect of a teammate's status. 

For example, if one dies: Nothing happens. I believe when it first happens it says you need to hire someone new, but the game will just give you one, but it doesn't matter because they're indistinguishable from one another anyway.
If they're stressed or anxious, they don't seem to get trigger happy or do a fight/flight/freeze when in fights. I don't have to send them away to therapy or on medical leave, the game does that for you but again, the game just replaces them with another identical person who is as far as I can see no different. It seems like a system designed to make your care about your other officers and look after them, but ultimately it's implemented so poorly it made me more indifferent as a result of frustration than anything else. It feels like a last minute "What if we had management mechanics?" in a game that I don't think really needed more. 

It's a blast in multiplayer if you can get a game. I have definitely met more weirdos compared to other games, but that's  par for the course considering the game and its contents.

> Banging a door with C2
> Bad guy singing "coooops" 🎵
> Instant 360° turn and full blast on me
> Dies
> Restart the game 

Every fight with a bot is like a boss fight.

Best game ever. Will definitely chain dying again.

This game is very good and i shoot people in their head with a grenade launcher. BUT STOP TAKING UP SO MUCH SPACE IN MY HARD DRIVE STOP UPDATING EVERY DAY.

roleplaying as an IDF operative during a raid has never felt so fulfilling
Suspect has a gun? Shot dead
Suspect has a knife? Shot dead
Suspect is both armed with a weapon and has a bomb vest? Shot dead (the entire squad perished due to my shenanigans)
Suspect is unarmed with a bomb vest? Shot dead (The war crime tribunal has nothing on me as I am also dead)
Suspect is not a suspect? Shot dead
Suspect is not a suspect? Alternatively, tasered to within an inch of his life, and then also shot dead
Footnote: Never stay out in the open, and never stay in cover. The AI will shoot absolutely anything that moves, even if it cannot see it.

The new DLC is great, better performance, more stability, great new maps with a lot of character and ambience. New weapons and attachments are cool too. The things I don't like are :
- The fog, too much of it 
- Non new pistols, the game really needs more pistols. a double stack 1911 (AKA 2011 variant) would be great ! 


Its a goood game they just dont know hot to label their options correctly. If youre wondering how to cycle the different teams like red and blue, its the mouse wheel, Yeah for some reason they thought of calling them fucking elements lmao.

I cannot for the life of me comprehend why the reviews for this game are 'Overwhelmingly Positive' at the moment. 
It's horribly unoptimized. I can run games like the Dead Space remake with stable 60 FPS on High Settings. Here, I'm always around 40-50. The game makes my computer sound like a jet engine, and it also crashed on me three times already. The loading times are also long.

Speaking of loading times, why is there no retry option in this game?? Every time you die, you have to sit through the unskippable score screen, multiple loading screens, and you also have to go back to the headquarters each time and restart the mission manually. Why do I even have to wait 10 seconds when starting a mission in single player? This is not multiplayer. It's such a waste of time.

This is a big problem, because you'll die constantly in this game. The AI is cheating. Your teammates are braindead, but the suspects can shoot you in the head from accross the map and through small gaps. I've been shot through walls multiple times. There were times when I started a mission, and the suspects began shooting at me from accross the map within a few seconds.

There are features missing here that you can find in SWAT 4. Why can't I give orders to my teammates through the camera? Why are there no snipers? The game is clearly a SWAT 4 rip-off, so they could have implemented these features.

AI is still ass after years of development and many of the maps are way too big

Great game but am struggling to get the mods to work for it.

generally great game but since the patch 1 from 17th december on some maps, for example the first mission on the gas station i get a gpu utilization of around 50% with massive stuttering at then ca. 70 fps which doesnt happen in the hq or anywhere else i dont know but maybe that helps to figure out where to look for

How stupid devs must be for not using workshop for mods, instead lets use some awkward bad service which doesn't even work when you want to. Fix it to workshop and I change my review to recommend!

Terrible gameplay with 4 years of development leading to the worst AI ever coded in the industry of gaming. The idea and ambition of making a "realistic" police/SWAT simulation was prioritized over player experience. Furthermore, the goal towards realism made the game harder to run in lower end computers and despite putting the game on lowest settings, it still runs like shit. It has been almost a year since the 1.0 release, and 3 years since it's alpha, and the AI is still moronic as ever. Shooting through walls, able to detect player at all times, with laser accuracy aimbot, in my humble opinion should've been the first task to polish and playtest multiple times during development. In conclusion, these developers put their eggs into one basket thus creating a shitty "realistic simulation" video game, which other companies since 2000 has created before.

Rough Push for 1.0, but DLCs and (very on time) updates smooth the entire game out, 10/10 recommended

great game and idk if the devs are gonna see this but the game needs some tweaking. first its super incompatable with the in game mods and no matter how many times i validate the game files it crashes without notice. this game has so much potential and is already super good but the devs need to stop focusing on DLC's and addons and work on the base game

The Pong minigame is reletivly buggy and you can score hits out of bounds. Fix please.

Idea is great, game has real potential. Unfortunately devs focus on bringing out DLC while there are still massively game breaking bugs in the game that have been there from day one. Don't fall for this cash grab.

Super good SWAT game, pretty realistic as well. Singleplayer mode is very well made to be enjoyable even if you don't have friends. The game is very methodical and slow which is a nice change of pace from usual shooters serving as a breath of fresh air. The gameplay can feel hard to control at first but thats part of it, since you have to get used to maneuvering around realistic environments and dealing with pretty well made AI. Overall I definitely recommend it, but if you are gonna get it just beware that the first time you play it, it might not click right away so just give it a proper try.

Campaign would be good if the AI wasnt complete and utter trash. If you want to play co-op and you play in a region with a low player count, then its pretty much impossible to play the game as it will say, "failed to connect to a server with acceptable ping". 

Waste of money SWAT4 is 10x better even if they improved the AI SWAT4 is still a much superior game and its way cheaper online.

This game For the players who looking for challenge an excitement!

This game is just unrealistic, when you shoot an innocent instead of being suspended with pay while they wait for internal investigations to clear you, you lose points
