"Counter-Strike 2 delivers stunning visuals and refined gameplay, making it a worthy successor to CS:GO. However, the removal of popular modes and macOS support feels like a step backward for some fans."

favorite game

Full of cheaters

this game has so many cheaters around, so this game directly taught me how to be better at talking sht and cursing someone's entire family bloodline, race, and nationality too. And I'm lovin it

10/10

Such a shitty game. It really is so tragic to have countless hours put to waste after bad decisions to get rid of a better version of the game. CS2 is unironically so much worse than every aspect of CS:GO.

Anti-cheat is still shi*, but game is very good in almost everything.

Best way to learn russian

: )

In almost every competitive game there are 8 cheaters.
I am the one of the rest 2, while the other is about to quit CS2.

CS:GO is a classic! Super fun, fast-paced, and always keeps you on your toes. The gameplay is solid, and the community is great. Skins and customization add extra fun, but the gambling and scamming issues are a big downside. Be careful when trading or unboxing, as these can lead to scams or losing money. Despite that, if you love FPS games, CS:GO is definitely worth playing!

Good

is fun

i wish more companies followed in valve's footsteps. 

i spent thousands of dollars on csgo skins, and in a matter of months those same skins appreciated better than my entire stock portfolio has in the last 5 years. And solely because gaben slapped a "2" at the tail end of the name of a game that has remained identical for the past two decades. 

god bless you gaben for giving me a return on my investment. I have 0 interest in playing this regurgitation, but to whatever zoomer bought my 10 year old skins, you're a real one

It is best game ever

Unless Valve fixes the problem with Russian population swarming EU servers, then this game stays unplayable.

They are not compatible for playing this game with the rest of us. You need communication in order to win. It's impossible. There is also a lot of friendly fire and deliberate bad play to annoy you and make you suffer. You can't leave but you still get kicked in case they are stacked in 4.

What is the point in being miserable for 15 rounds, not being able to leave while I'm getting bullied only to be kicked at the end of the game?

Why do you refuse to address this problem Valve? Your game is being ruined mostly by one population and you ignore it.

fire (fix the anti cheat please)

good shoot game

Game nostalgia saya sejak sd, hingga sekarang pun masih main walau ulang dari smp

played this game for a full day, which is definitely not long compared to the others that play this game, but i have found it fun in the time i have played it, will definitely spend more time on it, and will continue to play the practise gamemode so i can feel good dominating the AIs.

Apart form the toxic people, it a good game.

gut

As a CS player with more than 6,000 hours of game duration, I sincerely hope that Steam can provide official CS2 game support for Mac systems. After all, Steam provides a client for macOS, but CS2 does not support macOS. I have seen many CS2 players on the Internet who want to play on Mac like me, such as YouTube, Steam Game Community and Discord. Like Apple's press conferences in recent years, Apple's press conference is used by developers to evaluate Windows games in Ma C. With the GPTK components running above, Apple has also officially launched more and more native Mac games, such as Dead Stranding, Resident Evil and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077. I have reason to believe that the game ecology of macOS is getting better and better, and I also hope that only in this way can we hear more gamers' voices. After all, CS2 has a Linux version!!

good.

excellent game yes shoudl be more protective towards hax!

fuck this game


Great game..

I <3 Gambling

Nice only Russhans

shit game

YES

Good

YES

Better then Valorant. Fix cheater issue and everything else is good. Also work on new contents rather then only skins.

- This game is chock full of the nerdiest, Reddit-loving-type of weirdos 
- Anti-cheat doesn't work
- Kicks you and labels the reason a VAC issue when the reality is the game is broken and you have to verify your files and resync to the cloud in order to get reconnected to the servers
- Easiest platform to hack on, yet the ignorant community supports the hacks when they're benefiting
- So many hackers they defend each other and claim hacks are almost nonexistent

+ Getting called a hacker when you do well because 80% of top fraggers do

Great game to chill and play with your friends

THis game is so buns in this current state. I can't even run my favorite maps anymore.

...

is gud

Cheater-Strike 2

This game bugs out so much it sucks. Valve hates movement and makes the game aids to play. csgo was literally a perfect game and then cs2 ruined it. bad game no fun

Game will take time to learn. It's a skill based game. Learn the maps, the weapons, the recoil patterns, and over time the normal player behavior in the game.

- no proper Anti-cheat

- bad optimization with terrible frametime spikes

- awful netcode and lag compensation

- no 128 tick servers instead half-baked "sub-tick" time travel bs.

- Sudowoodo woonky player animations (eg. players doing splits while running sideways)

- dead playerbase for actual competitive/premiere matches 90% of the "players" are gambler/skin-scammers or bots which includes gambling for underage kids.

A lot of cheaters

stupid chud game, tf2 mogs 1000x

Very good game, approved!

Love CS2's game play and community. It is now one of my most played games. I love the comp game modes and casual playlist. Only gripe i have about this game is the anti-cheat which you can get around playing with hackers every lobby by using third party sites like FACEIT. CSGO was still better when it came to hardware and feel of the game but CS2 is getting the job done. FIX THE ANTICHEAT AND I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS, any comp game mode is unplayable even if you have a good rep on steam you will get matched with hackers 5 out of 10 games even in casual which is just sad. Closet cheaters run this game! Kernel level anticheat needed just for casual players or the game is gonna dry up bc nobody is legit and cheats are easier to get by the day.

Valve refuses to help regulate underage gambling.

very fun game

Fuck this game bruh

trash game

It's CS, what more is there to explain. Has been here since you were born and will be here past your death. Its the balance, the base, it is like home.

Sadly still just worse than cs:go. Things annoying me most: 

The "better" graphics are nice with a dedicated gpu, but basically i dont care. It's annoying on mobile GPUs. lowest settings on 1440p (with upscaling setting to Performance) to get quite stable 60fps. CS:GO would have had easily over 100 with not lowest settings. I hate that i have to disable AA and render in a low resolution. Would prefer just having a simple AA on and being able to render at full 1440p.

The new mission/arsenal. ITS JUST XP GRINDING .... like the level system ... what a dissapointment. No funny challenges or something like that. Saw it and bought it "yeah finally a good time to play some CS again", but am totally regreting I paid money for that thing :/ 

Just give me CS:GO back please

Been looking for a shooter to play besides COD and this one is great

Full of cheaters, Anti-Cheat doesn't work, Not Optimized

good game but high prices 


Lets get serious here. I met this Handsome boy Elite on rust. One day he said, "Why, TDP, Why dont we try play some CSGO?" I said fricken hell yeah bro. 9 years later, this is my life. 9am-5pm I play CSGO. 5pm-2am I play gang beasts. When I play CS, I forget about all about my real life problems. All I can think about is getting those high ranks and unboxing skins. All my bestest friends I met playing CSGO. Where would I be without this game. In a ditch popping pills probably. Lets wrap this up. CSGO IS LAAAFFF

nice game

cheaters

paly it

good game, toxic community but good game, you'll have fun. get it, it's free.

very good game, but sadly there are still much hackers, alltough its one of the best shooter games, if not the best free one.

Some russian guy screamed at me because i accedentally killed him, 10/10 Would play again

Good way to learn Russian

best game

Its an amazing game, community, the skins, the pro games, the name "Counter strike" means so much now.
Of course its frustrating as hell realising that im older, not as good and as passionate about the game as some of my enemies but 1500 hours and almost 10 years later, I still play it and keep coming back which says a lot.
I think its almost impossible for new players to enjoy it now as im at 8k on premiere and get my ass handed to me plenty of times and I dont consider myself a terrible player.

Overall, awesome game, csgo was better but its a terrible time to start playing the game. The peak was about 10 years ago

Best game

best game ever

this is very relaxing game


good game


got ddosed and hacked on in 4/5 games i played. 10/10

absolute cinema

,

Cheaters in every session (prime). In the mood for rage? Play it; Want to have fun? play another game until you want to get rid of pent-up aggressions.

competitve and funny


Needs to be free of cheaters and everything will be good 💯

Hard

love and hate but game will always be fun

One of the shittiest update is this rigged game called CS2, I cannot count how many times I die behind the wall after a jiggle peek. Idk what causes this, but based on the internet it is something called sub-tick. Shit as fuck

Very good game

cs best game ever

If you want to rage a bit, this game is for you.

now i'm not playing Counter Strike 2 but Cheater Strike 2

very good game i love it

Can the russian stop playing this game?

i think its way more better then DOTA 2 for playing fun

Ah, Counter-Strike – the game where you can spend countless hours perfecting your smoke grenades and corner-clearing techniques... only to die within the first five seconds to someone who decided that the ultimate strategy is buying a Desert Eagle and relying on pure luck.

Welcome to a world where strategy is king – until someone decides to buy an AWP on an eco round because, well, "why not." 🎯 And while you’re busy meticulously coordinating with your team, the enemy just rushes B like it’s a recess game – and somehow it works.

And let’s not forget your teammates. A perfect blend of shouty mic warriors who seem physically incapable of speaking without Caps Lock and those mysterious silent players who never communicate, always end up the last alive, and somehow think they can ninja defuse a bomb surrounded by three enemies.

But hey, nothing beats the thrill of a clutch moment, when the bomb’s ticking in your ears, and you forget the defuse code – or better yet, spend the entire round trying to find the bomb in a sea of smoke. Counter-Strike: the game where you truly learn patience – or at least how fast you can rage quit.

i met people who shoot heads while looking at the ground very good game i recommend

Not worth the grind on original cs to play this ripoff íts soo bad

Fun

re5t7ytwse45ye54rty

no.

counter strike made me strike my counter

Matches Are Very Diffucult (i am not that bad)

i don t like csgo

Fuck This Piece of shit game. They fucked everything that worked in csgo and now we forced to play this garbage source 2 with worse performance and less options.

joc de terminati

CS2 is similar to the game CS:GO but, cs2 is a bit difficult with the aim otherwise I would say it’s the same game and it’s fun and good graphics! I recommend CS2 much.

nice game

love this game but please get rid of cheaters

The best is DONK

Hope this game has no dumb cheater!

Thrash matchmaking full of cheaters

[list]
[*]VAC still sucks c*ck and balls.
[*]Sub-tick servers still suck c*ck and balls.
[*]Case odds still suck c*ck and balls.
[*]It's still better than Valorant, but that ain't saying much because that sh*t sucks major c*ck and balls.
[*]HOWEVER, graphics look as nice as my c*ck and balls.(super nice, take my word for it)
[/list]

Recommended only because CSGO was murdered for this shell of a replacement, Valorant is an e-couple cringe fest with overwatch abilities, and there's no other competition in this category.

That being said, when Cache returns, this game becomes 10/10.

Counter-Strike 2 refreshes the iconic game with improved graphics, smoother mechanics, and new features while preserving its tactical essence. A must-play for fans and newcomers alike.

What to expect? full of cheaters lack of updates really need a lot of improvements

please for you own sake, dont get hooked on this game. Or atleast know the risk to your mental health. 
10/10 would play again tomorrow.

By far the absolute worst release of the Counter-Strike franchise, only thing keeping this game alive is all the skin gambling addicted children from CS:GO, which was a million times better game with better mechanics and more vibrant graphics. Furthermore, the walking in this game is awful, cheeks, feels like you're floating on a boat. The only good thing about this game, the better and more realistic graphics, is ruined by the the tiny mini sized guns which poop on the immersion. I don't even wanna start with the cheaters. Would not recommend to absolutely anyone with half a brain. Go play Valorant or R6S, better games, better community. If I had to choose between not having internet for the rest of my life or playing this garbage again I would happily stay offline forever.

the new anti-cheat is amazing guys, only meet like 7 cheaters in my past 5 games :D I can see valve is improving day by day.

Super pitchers and cervical spondylosis patients can't be the same person, right?  Right?

Every game you play there is a cheater i have been wallbanged i have been killed by a sniper from the other side of the map when he was shooting the ground its crazy.

- Cheating issues in CS2, even in premier or competitive mode. (ranking matches)
- random server crash or spikes which doesn't happen on other games.
- barely any communication in premier or competitive mode. (player base problem, mostly russian)


not very recommend

Valve do absolutely nothing to stop cheaters or toxic behaviour in this game. You can almost guarantee every match will have at least one person wall hacking or the even more obvious aim bots. There's instances where some servers will have multiple AI bots going at once so you can't even kick them. I only play with some friends I've made online to try and avoid it, but even that is rare. 
The toxic behaviour I've come across as a female player is also incredibly bad, but again Valve do nothing about this either. I'm used to it having played these games for around 15 years, but it's a shame that still nothing is done about it these days. 
Reporting anything gets you nowhere. 
The game is also missing so many maps and modes that used to exist on previous versions of CS. If I didn't enjoy those random days with friends online I would just go ahead and uninstall it.

I have played many versions of this game and I am aware that people cheat and sometimes it becomes hard to tell when people are cheating or legitimately better. In ranking I made it to Distinguished Master Guardian and started to see losses that were absolute or games that were a tie. Even the games that were a tie felt like people were toggling exploits. It's time for me to stop dedicating time, emotion and energy into something that no longer feels fulfilling. Congratulations to the dev team that got all the money I spent on skins. It's too bad they don't care about the game. I enjoyed playing for a long time until now.

If you play cs2  you will end up +Depressed+sad+broken+tilt+epileptic+antisocial+tilted+debil+aucustic+paranoic+single+alcoholic+K/D drocher+bipolar+cigaret addict+gambler+1000€ in dept+ never buy skins+broken table+broken keyboard 
BUT I love this game

Unfortunately as of December 2024, game is absolutely infested with cheaters and bots. A lot of maps and features are still missing from CS:GO. the benefits of the new engine for me are overshadowed by the unsatisfactory updates and general lack of a lot of stuff from the GO. Still a lot of fun with friends, but getting queued against cheaters even on premiere it's making the overall experience sour.

Full of cheaters, Anti-Cheat doesn't work, Not Optimized, but I like it

This game is full of cheaters. Every few months, valve gives temporary ban to a few but doesn't permanent ban them and they come back and the cycle repeats. It would be one of the best games if it implemented hard policies like permanent ban or restarting competitive/premier level/elo for cheaters.

The unwanted shadow of CSGO used to be able to play this on my lower end PC but ever since the gambling cash grab armory battle pass update the games performance has significantly deteriorated, Everytime i play anything other than dust 2 or mirage on competitive the game becomes unplayable, went from having 200 fps on csgo to being unable to play the game i loved whatsoever! Thanks alot valve!

I began playing this game as a fluent English speaker, after many hours I can confirm I am completely fluent in Russian and the art of cursing at people in Russian.

Like in the adv clip, for over 2 decades CS and valve team can`t make anti cheat that will ban cheaters. This game it total crap with the toxic community and cheaters that will ruin your matchmaking.

And as adv says "What u see is what u dont get", because it`s broken even now and the amaunt of cheaters in game is absolutly insane.

Hello my honest review after 700 hrs completing CS2. I have played many fps games in my life and this is one of the best fps games I which consider in my best fps games list.I am not so pro until now but trying to do good and I know this game need no words to describe so stop thinking more about it and start your cs2 journey. Yeah u will meet too many hackers in this game so just hate hackers not the game.

i had a bad experience with this game because of a hacker who can see us behind the walls all 5 of my teammates reported him and nothing happened

I really love cs 2 caise im a big fan with counter Strike games, i played cs 1.6 when i was a kid and i fell in love w this game, but please work on ur anticheat

As soon as you reach 15k in prime mode, the HVH game starts. As soon as you reach the rank of master guardian on any map, HVH will begin. A completely non-working VAC spoils the whole impression of the game

Hello,Valve.
I want to start by saying,that your game is absolute piece of fucking shit. Fix this bullshit ah hitboxes as soon as possible,its impossible to play. You create new skins,new fcking stupids cases,retarded animations,but you cant fix movement,cant fix hitboxes,and CANT BAN STUPID AMOUNT OF CHEATERS. I hope you read this one day and think about your stupid ass game. I spent almost 1.6k hours on this trash ass game,and i couldnt be more dissapointed that i am now. Bring back counter strike global offensive. It was the best game ever created,everything was good,so smooth look at the highlights of it. IT WAS PERFECTED,godly optimised and worked without any lags. Now you made a fucking retarded game,which requires nasa pc,0 optimizations. Valve to end it all,i want to say,YOU GUYS ARE BULLSHIT

love it. analogous to life in that it is an interactive chess game that lends itself to you the more emotionally controlled, riveted, engaged, and composed you are. on days you are feeling vice versa, it punishes you in a way that can allow you to know that you are still on this plane of existence that gives you what you put in. put in the work and reap the benefits. love this game, will always love this game. 5v5 competitive variable and ever-evolving, with new metas to find and old metas to cling to, and everything in between. the people online are no exception. you will find toxic lobbies in the dead of the night, only to realize everyone there is at their wit's end or whelm, just as much as playing in the day will get you more of a controlled crowd. I have love for both crowds and everything in between, for that is also life; a mixed bag, ever effected by whether or not you have your shit together outside the game so that you can put your best energy (or worst, depending on the day) inside of it. god bless gavin, god bless america, god bless the reader, and god bless myself for finding this wonderful game.

fuck this stupid motherfucking ass game and the shit ass motherfuckers that made it i genuinely despise this fucking game am I still gonna keep playing it? absolutely but i still fucking despise this piece of shit game and it annoys me I mean how come when im shooting an opponent at point blank range with the nova or the xm or any motherfucking gun for that matter it's as if im wielding a fucking nerf gun but my opponents can use the nova as a fucking sniper??? and should i talk about how the game is literally unplayable without prime because you will run across cheaters in every fucking game valve please fix your game fix vac and go fuck yourself and as for everybody else if you wanna grow up to be a reasonable person don't play this stupid piece of shit game

CS2 impeccably captures the essence of futility and existential dread, wrapped in the guise of a tactical shooter. The graphics are so photorealistic, they don’t just illuminate the battlefield but also the void in my soul. My in-game performance is so tragically inept, even my own teammates seem to question the point of respawning me. Every molotov explosion is a vivid reminder that while pixels can respawn, the flames of real-life failures burn perpetually. A masterclass in simulated chaos and metaphysical reflection.

This game is fun but for those who are at least at a medium level...
competetive mode and premiere mode has less cheaters ... but casual is full of them.
overall is a great game.

I love counter-strike.

Its a great game, but…

It has a loooot of cheaters
and not a lot of content has been released (big chunk cases).

I really like this game, but its not in a good state.

Best game ever. Just sucks that it has the worst anti-cheat system ever as well. Been playing this game 10+ years and I don't know if I will ever stop.

how is the new version worse than the old version. make counter-strike great again.

The worst game ever! Cheaters all the place. VAC is sleeping. Reporting does nothing. I started playing premier, I once got into a game with cheaters. Both in my team and in enemy team. Reported them, they kept playing. Proof here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2327730028
I will quit this game and uninstall it. Anticheat is a joke in this game.

Had to wait 10 hours for the game to download, just to get spawn-killed every time I join a game.

shit game filled with cheaters who gas light you into thinking youre not good, assholes. Absolutely shit game without a working anticheat

This game isn't very good, when I move my bullets go flying in 1000 different directions. This isn't a real shooting game, the bullets make no sense. 0/10 this game is for those Dark Souls or Elder Rings types.

valve just needs to work on optimization, server issues, hit registration, whatever this new damage prediction is, getting rid of wall hacks, getting rid of spin botting, getting rid of aim hackers, network issues, and actually giving a fuck about the game, and maybe it could be a 6/10. In it's current state between cheaters and network issues it's horrifically unplayable. I would take cs:go in it's worst state over this most days.

Lots of cheaters and no anti-cheat, no ranked (as a new player I don't know if I'm playing vs pro or vs same noob as me). I have strong feeling people cuм to match to run around, to do some pew-pew and to throw some flashbangs under their feet. The only option to play this game is to call my friends to talk to them and the game is running like background music. If you want to play tactical shooter it is better to find another game with working ranked mode and where people are strongly motivated to play as a team and with good anti-cheat. Strongly not reccomend.


Why I Love CS:GO 2

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has long been regarded as one of the most iconic and influential first-person shooters (FPS) of all time. With the release of CS:GO 2, many aspects of the game have evolved, building upon its established legacy while introducing fresh mechanics and features. But why do I find myself drawn to CS:GO 2? The reasons are multifaceted, touching on gameplay depth, community engagement, and its ability to keep me on the edge of my seat. This essay will explore why CS:GO 2 is not just another shooter, but a game that keeps me coming back for more.

1. The Core Gameplay Loop
At its heart, CS:GO 2 revolves around a deceptively simple yet deeply strategic gameplay loop. Two teams, usually of five players, battle it out in various competitive modes. One team defends bomb sites, while the other attempts to plant and detonate the bomb. This simple setup leads to countless tactical decisions, reflex challenges, and intense moments of drama. What sets CS:GO 2 apart is how this core loop is refined, polished, and optimized. It isn’t just about shooting; it’s about positioning, communication, timing, and, above all, teamwork.

In CS:GO 2, this gameplay has been enhanced with refined mechanics and new features. The addition of smoother movement, improved weapon handling, and more dynamic map design make every round feel fresh. Players can experiment with different strategies, trying new approaches with each match. Whether you’re planting the bomb as a Terrorist or holding down a site as a Counter-Terrorist, the decisions you make affect the outcome of the game in profound ways.

2. The Tactical Depth
One of the things I love most about CS:GO 2 is its tactical depth. While most shooters focus on fast-paced action and reflexes, CS:GO 2 rewards careful planning, strategic thinking, and coordination with your team. Every match is like a chess match, where the right move at the right time can lead to victory, but a single misstep can lead to disaster.

The game offers a wide array of weapons, grenades, and equipment that add layers of tactical complexity. Smoke grenades, flashbangs, Molotovs, and decoys all have specific uses that can turn the tide of battle when used correctly. A well-timed smoke can block an enemy’s vision, while a flashbang can stun them and allow your team to push forward. Understanding how to use these tools effectively separates a good player from a great one.

Moreover, CS:GO 2 introduces refined mechanics, giving players even more ways to express their tactics. The slight differences in weapon accuracy, movement speed, and recoil add an extra layer of nuance to the game. Whether it’s a smoke execution on the B site or a fast rush down mid, the ability to think critically in every situation is what makes CS:GO 2 so engaging.

3. The Competitive Nature
Another key reason why I love CS:GO 2 is the highly competitive environment it fosters. From the moment I enter a match, I am immersed in a world of players who are all working towards a single goal: to win. The game’s ranking system ensures that I’m always placed in matches with players of a similar skill level, allowing for a fair and balanced experience. The stakes feel high in every match, and the sense of progression is deeply satisfying.

As a player, you can rise through the ranks by improving your skills, learning new strategies, and becoming more attuned to the game’s mechanics. Whether you’re playing in casual matches or more serious competitive modes, the drive to win and improve never wanes. The match-to-match tension, coupled with the pressure of maintaining or improving your rank, creates an adrenaline-pumping experience that is hard to find elsewhere.

Moreover, CS:GO 2’s matchmaking system, with its emphasis on fairness and skill-based matchmaking, ensures that I am always faced with a challenge, keeping the gameplay exciting and rewarding. The constant push to be better, to climb the ladder, and to prove myself against the best is part of what makes CS:GO 2 so compelling.

4. The Community and Esports Scene
Beyond the gameplay itself, one of the things that keeps me coming back to CS:GO 2 is its vibrant and passionate community. From casual players to professional esports athletes, the game’s ecosystem is rich with content, discussions, and opportunities to connect with others. The community is a place where you can find like-minded individuals, learn from others, and forge friendships.

The CS:GO 2 community is also deeply intertwined with the esports scene. Professional tournaments, such as the CS:GO Major Championships, provide thrilling and competitive entertainment that draws in millions of viewers. The excitement of watching top-tier players compete at the highest level inspires me to become better. These tournaments are not just about showcasing skill, but about highlighting the depth and complexity of the game. The strategies, mind games, and mechanics displayed by professional players are awe-inspiring and serve as a learning tool for players like myself.

Additionally, CS:GO 2’s modding community offers even more opportunities for creativity and engagement. Custom maps, skins, and game modes allow players to personalize their experience and try new things. This constant stream of content helps to keep the game feeling fresh and dynamic.

5. The Thrills of High-Stakes Moments
CS:GO 2 is a game full of tension and high-stakes moments. The heart-racing feeling of clutching a round in a 1v4 situation or making a last-minute defuse on a ticking bomb is something only CS:GO 2 can deliver. Every match offers countless opportunities for these types of moments. These moments are what elevate the game beyond its mechanics and into the realm of emotional investment.

The game’s sound design and visual cues also heighten these experiences. The crisp sound of footsteps, the rush of adrenaline as the bomb ticks down, the satisfying crack of a well-placed headshot – these sensory elements make every moment feel intense and impactful. The combination of gameplay, atmosphere, and the unpredictability of each match creates a thrilling experience that is hard to replicate.

6. The Continuous Evolution
Finally, what makes CS:GO 2 truly special is how it continues to evolve. Valve’s commitment to improving the game ensures that players are constantly presented with new updates, balancing changes, and refinements. Whether it’s a new map, weapon adjustments, or bug fixes, the developers are always working to improve the experience. These updates show that the game is alive and growing, rather than stagnant.

The transition from CS:GO to CS:GO 2 has brought about a more polished and refined experience. The visuals have been updated, the movement and shooting mechanics feel smoother, and the game’s overall polish is a testament to Valve’s attention to detail. At the same time, they’ve kept the core aspects that make CS:GO 2 unique intact, ensuring that veterans of the original game feel at home while new players can easily jump in.

Conclusion
In conclusion, I like CS:GO 2 for a multitude of reasons: its deep tactical gameplay, the thrill of competitive play, the passionate community, and the continuous evolution of the game. It’s not just a game I play; it’s a game I immerse myself in, constantly striving to improve, connect with others, and enjoy the rollercoaster of emotions it offers. Whether it’s the high-stakes clutch moments or the strategic depth, CS:GO 2 is more than just a shooter – it’s a test of skill, teamwork, and endurance. That’s why I keep coming back, game after game, eager for the next match, the next challenge, and the next victory.





I've never played a gun full of hackers like this, before like honest, every loby there is one hacker that is running around with a fucking pistol killing every fucking one with just one hit to the head. fuck this shit

Love Valve, great game; but they're trying like hell to hold onto this game.

fuck this bitch ass game this game got more cheaters than legit players stop focusing on the fucking deadlock 
and make a new operation hoes

the most shit aiming in a fps game I have ever played. the bullet spread goes everywhere but straight....even when standing still!!!!!!

Games crawling with little cheating rats, valve don't care because they make millions from cases.

yesterday, i had a internet failure, wich made me automatically leaving the match, resulting in me getting banned for a week, because of a internet failure. fix your game

If you speak English, or your not Russian, this game wont be fun at all.. because half of the people if not all are Russian you cant communicate with them, and if you try they might mock you.. overall the gameplay is good

This game is a piece of shit with tryhard ass ngas like go fucking end it bro nobody likes your bitch ass fix the ranked match making

shit fucking game fulll of cheater do something valve but a decent game and its been up for years

Looks Great... Runs like kakadodo (CS2)
What you see is NOT what you get :)

Pretty decent game for being in Alpha-access stage the past 12 years..
it might be finished by the year 2032, but keep your hopes limited.

Do i play it regularly? 
: Yes.
Do i enjoy it?
: Yes, but i hate myself while doing it.
Do i recomend this?
: i dont recomend stepping on glass shards, but each to their own... sure give it a go you might like it.

Played for the first time after the death of the CS of the GO. 

-Got kicked in my first ever casual match
-Got yelled at in Russian and kicked

This may be because I am bad BUT IT WAS CASUAL!

In conclusion
Piece of shit!
Where are the achievements Valve?

The most helpful Communication I had in Game:
+ How much for Kebab your Garbage Country?
- it is free for your mom


Need to fix a lot of things, but overall pretty good csgo update

Plagued with cheaters. When i'm not lagging due to poor servers and net code it's fun, but then it gets ruined by wallhackers.

Counter-Strike 2 players with Prime Status are matched with other Prime Status players and are eligible to receive Prime-exclusive souvenir items, item drops, and weapon cases.

This package grants Prime Account Status in Counter-Strike 2


thnx my team \ dimmu \ floki \  strange

this game tests my mental sanity against the multitude of variants of european inbreds.

If you enjoy getting railed by cheaters and earraped by russians with poor-quality microphones, then this is the game for you!

very goood dgamei tink it bestest gam in al timme veri good gmem yeas yes yes yse es (:

this game is so ass id rather watch paint fucking dry than play comp with my retarded and brain dead teammates CS2, I can’t believe I’m still wasting my time with you. What happened to the game I used to love? The constant lag, terrible matchmaking, and bugs that never seem to get fixed are ruining the experience. It’s like the developers are more focused on squeezing money out of players with microtransactions than actually improving the core game. I spend more time waiting for servers to load or watching teammates perform like they're on another planet than I do actually enjoying the gameplay. Every update feels like it makes things worse, and the community? Don’t even get me started on the toxicity. It’s like Valve has completely forgotten what made Counter-Strike great. The thrill of competitive play is lost in a sea of glitches and design choices that just make the game feel broken. This is not the game I fell in love with, and at this rate, I’m not sure I can keep wasting my time hoping it gets better.

I wish you had released a standalone game, gifted it to CSGO players, and not erased the CSGO game.
Lost all progression, achievement, easy access to community servers, maps and assets.
Rushed game release.
Less of a problem since its release, but it still is: cheaters.
On this topic, the repressive approach to fight cheaters doesn't seem to make much of an impact, as is always the case in this type of game.
As for the gameplay, Competitive mode became worthless as it is a hub for smurfs and cheaters.
Premier mode is great but the ranking system is broken and smurfs are everywhere, tho cheaters less so.

in game it runs fine, but for some reason on menu it runs like complete ass, you cant change the saturation levels in the video settings, still missing maps and features that were available on csgo, arms race only has 3 fucking maps, ridiculous amount of cheaters, and valve overwrote csgo with this unfinished wet shart, you have to use console to change bot difficulty when practicing with bots (why????)

never even played this game before but it do be playing kinda when it do be doing it but sometimes you know how it be when it do be doing something else than you wanted it to be doing at a certain time and place but yeah something like that

love the graphics update gameplay is so smooth. less hackers

CS2 might be the new game, but it made me realize how much I miss the days of CS:GO. Those simple moments were filled with pure excitement and joy. Where is that sense of classic gameplay? Where are those matches that felt like being part of history? CS2 looks visually stunning, but it lacks the soul of CS:GO. I wish I could go back to those days when the game was more about skill and creating beautiful memories than anything else.

Its a solid fps game with a lot of focus on gunplay rather than it's competitors, But it has a major hacker problem which makes it very frustrating to play sometimes. So for that i'm giving it a thumbs down.

Best game ever, very chill players and friendly teammates

The GAME is getting better.. the PEOPLE however,, super school shooty! i wholeheartedly believe skinz, 3rd party chats (i.e. discord, etc) and making the game free with no overwatch whatsoever has contributed in a major way to the decline of this game. atleast playing in comp. modes.

Go fucking play valorant. This is fucking useless:
Getting cooldown for every single thing;
Cheaters not getting banned;
Especially there is a fucking cheater in every game, playing ranked? cheaters, playing unranked? cheaters
valve fuck you go fix your game


At the moment it's not worth it to get into. If you're looking for a competitive 5v5 shooter, you'd be better off playing Valorant or, if you choose CS, to start out playing on FACEIT right away (they have a working anticheat). The game is absolutely riddled with cheaters in all elos. It doesn't matter whether you're 1k or 30k - you will face cheaters and it WILL ruin your experience. Especially if you buy this game as someone who wants to try it because you saw a cool highlight from a major or your friends are playing it. The system automatically pairs you with people that have similiar playtime to you (0-50hrs), therefore you will face a lot of cheaters, because they tend to buy the game new on different accounts if they are getting banned. The first few hours will be unplayable; people shooting through walls from miles away, spinbotting, aimbotting, wallhacking - you name it. I own CS on another account where I have accumulated around 1.2k hours so I wasn't fully aware, but after purchasing the game on a new account and going through the new player experience, it's horror. Don't think it would get better if you have more hours logged on this game, nono, 80% of the people you see on the public leaderboard are cheaters because pro's aswell as semi pro's stopped playing premier (ranked) and avoid it to play FACEIT, because it's just hack vs hack lobbies. Valve doesn't give a fuck since microtransactions are whats keeping this game profitable and not the gameplay itself. Don't start with CS, start with Valorant. If you start out with CS and get in love with it you might get your heart broken because it's unplayable due to cheating. So yeah, great game, probably the best shooter there is, but unplayable for casuals who just want to click a ''Play'' button and get into some games.

great game honestly i love to chill and drink with the boys while getting lit on THE classic fps game. Try it out.

Really nice game
Got told my mother has a bigger penis than me
10/10 will play again

I'mma be honest. I wasn't much for this game, just played it with ma bois but eventually it started growing on me and now I really do enjoy the game a lot. The game features a lot of way to get better at i.e positioning, awareness, patience and ofc aiming (just to name a few). It's a lot of fun seeing your own skill increasing as you play tho the game does have a big issue with cheaters but even then you can just play on FaceIt which is suppose to help on that front. The community itself is a bit mixed. Lots of cringe and toxic people on there but that's just how it goes with online competitive games. 
Also the main menu music is a fu*king banger, I fu*k with it.
I've played a lot of Valorant and Call of Duty in my days and while they're great CS just feels a bit more serious and polished.

All in all it's a 8/10 for me as far as competitive online shooters go.

Good game, problem is that it is full of cheaters
