Extreme fun

good game

psylocke 😍🍑🍒

you cant move if you tap enter when your loading this has made me flag for being afk 3 times and i dont know how to stop it


They brought back mercy to the overwatch genre

this game is so ass

I haven't had this much fun playing a game in years.

dps need to stfu and let healers heal pls

amazing roster of characters

PYURR KEYOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great game.  It's what overwatch 2 should have been.

Awesome


This game may be the devil I'm selling my soul to.

MARVEL? YES

Overwatch 3

Good

Goodbye Overwatch I'm sorry what they did to you, but now I can play a good game

Fun Hero-Shooter game

It's much better than Concord and Overwatch 2.

The game and its agents/skills are very poorly optimized at the moment.  Some agents feel like they're clearly fillers with copy/paste.

The gameplay feels like a blend of popular titles; movement reminiscent of Fortnite and skills more aligned with Overwatch. While this mix has potential, refining these elements could help create a more cohesive and polished experience.

Lastly, the monetization part of it all will definitely detract from player enjoyment.

Basically, it's a very mobile-game-like experience when it comes to tasks and such. 

I tried the game and just had to uninstall after a few games. I've seen better and the game is just not ready by any means.



its really hard to play some of the characters, especially with one hand

First hero shooter I like.

overwatch if it was good

better than overwatch

Amazing game, it's multiplayer and so fun. They have such good designs and characters. the only flaw is that you're not gonna want to get off the game because it's so fun


Doesn't launch despite a 9 gb patch fix, tons of solutions find here and there on the internet and redownloading all over again. Their support is also completely useless, all they do is copy and paste those already made answers that aren't helpful in any way. 
Do better

I'm so glad something is finally going to kill overwatch

crashes alot for seemingly no reason


a

Almost most of the game time is during 200ms or above

the best competitor to overwatch 2 on the market so far.

VENOM MODE

wow can it get worse than this? idk maybe.

.

Outstanding art style, high degree of customization, an actually good practice range, a full fledged replay system, and a diverse array of characters.

Performance and game balance could use some work, but still a very polished game.

i get fucking raped by a shark and a red chick

Cant enjoy the game  when all it does is stutter. Tried every fix i can find. My pc is well over the reqs. just all around horrible experience so far.


fun with lots of cool heroes and villains to play! and its free!

Unable to play the game as it is hard crashing/locking my system, forcing me to power off/restart with power buttons.

After multiple attempts to adjust graphic settings even to the minimal settings still results in this crash in about 1 min starting game and being in the menu. 

As it stand this is dangerous to my system and I have to give it a negative review. I do hope this gets fixed in the future so I can try again but as it stands it is completely unplayable and risks damage to my system.

Fun!

jeff

no role queue.

i love this game never change marvel rivals

copied overwatches homework on fentanyl

I love females in this game

Lots of fun and lots of ass

Its a competitive, fun and super solid game. Exactly like overwatch just better. Also free...Free is good.

Characters don't load on screen for a solid 3 mins for me the first time i boot up the game , a persistent issue... I like the game because its different enough for it not to be an Overwatch or TF2 clone but not so different that it has no place in the hero shooter genre solid "mid" fun 5/10 (if you grab some friends 7/10 because of the teamup mechanic making character picks deliberate)

other than some performance issues, so far so good

Depends. If I'm winning, it's good. If I'm losing, its fucking garbage trash game.

I have over the required specs and I'm getting negative frames

why insta pick dps when you can play Support AND be the dps

OW3

Overwatch killer. Comic nerd heaven

this one of   
the best  games iv played

Damn addicting gameplay. Really does feel like a superhero when playing the Marvel superheroes.

Ceritfied Banger

I get kicked out off queue all the time and i always get a penalty for it when it's not even my fault. The game also crashes like every 5 games or so making me not enjoy the game. The game itself is not bad but when i get kicked out of it so many time i cant even enjoy like i might have done. Fix the bugs and maybe i will start playing again

game like overwatch but all your favorite marvel characters. play as the hulk and smash people. Play as  tony stark and sell weapons to Al qaeda. Be Jeff the shark and eat people to throw them off the map while performing a suicide dive bomb. 10/10

jeff go brrrrrrr

no woke good game

It's a good pass-time thrill that gives me that same competitive feel as some of my top fps competitors like Valorant or rainbow six siege, all round good pick with lots of options as to how to play and tackle objectives, and every character is easy to learn but with a steep and deep learning curve that makes it take time to truly master your favorite character but rewarding for those that have a main with several hours of play to back it. Shout-out to all my fellow support mains, you truly are the goats of the player base and we love and appreciate your team carries.

this game good

Disable one of my cpu core

Better than Overwatch

Such a amazingly fun game to play. Thank God it's so much better the that trash of a game OW2

the visuals and art style is very good but i am not a fan of 6v6 hero games

good game just need to be more optimized. thats all

big tonka

The graphics and animations are fantastic

very bad matchmaking

Game is good.

good game

jhakasss

PEAK GAME

NOT an overwatch clone

Absolutely fantastic game, this is what Overwatch 2 should have been. The only drawback is the rampant aimbotting, once that gets under control this will likely reign supreme in the hero shooter genre for a good while.

better than yba

Would be a really fun game if you didn't disconnect from 4/5 matches. Probably the worst networking I have ever seen. And of course they add a disconnect penalty, go figure.

JeeEEEEeeEEEEEeEEEEEEEEeeEEeEEEEEeEEEEEEEeFF

I felt that 19 inches of venom and it was not enjoyable

Goontacular game

Crashes every other game

its really good game but the fps is low and the quilty is really over Qullty is really good but fps

this is so skibidi why so serious sigma why so superciliousigma                                                                                                           I love this game and my favourite character is george bush

World wide rules is about no kids or abuse in games.
Meanwhile marvel rivals :
1) Adds shark that is cute and must be killed at all costs
2) Censores word boobs or some color names
3) Encourages 12+ peoples to think being lgbt is totally normal (logic - you say human body part : censored , while they literally teaches kids that lgbt is best because there is rule : no abbuse minors , and game is 12+)
4) Fact : words- words dick, tits, kiss : Restricted and censored while, "War'' ''kill'' ''murder'' is fine

Conclusion : got to love how modern society game makers in game that is 12 + push in to next gen to not reproduce more and more and meanwhile that to kill is fine...

I mean if you fookin disable boobs tits and dick or chick or so, then also restrict war kill and murder... i will never understand how that now is ok, meanwhile being normal is ''bannable'' feature




i love it

PLEASE JOIN MY CLAN ITS CALLED "marrrvel" we need good players, im begging, my mother wont even join

better ow

jarvis solo ult the family of 4

Pros:
- Playing a brand new hero shooter with 30 new characters and everyone is bad and doing goofy things is pretty refreshing
- Art style remembers me of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom which is awesome
- Heroes are all pretty fun to play and seem balanced
- There is very little toxicity

Cons:
- Bad visual clarity. It is hard to know what is going on sometimes, even more so than Overwatch
- Some mechanics feel clunky
- Not sure how the game will evolve after it becomes a sweatfest
- Bugs. The two most annoying ones for me are getting stuck in a black screen after a match (which requires restarting the game) and character models taking too long to load at the beggining of matches

Overall, it is a pretty fun, chaotic and refreshing game. Recommed to enjoy it while it is still new.

0% and 99% loading screen bug. unplayable

Game of the year, plus its free.

Spielt sich gut, macht Spaß, mehr Content und Helden wären wünschenswert, ansonsten bisher technisch gut, bis auf die Framerate abfällen bei z.B Dr. Strange Portal

Game is super fun. Really enjoy getting to play as MCU characters. There are a ton to select. Love it so far

I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Marvel Rivals.
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Marvel Rivals.
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours.
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Marvel Rivals.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

better than overwatch

The game controls is easy to understand and a real fun to play as your favourite heroes.

Im so glad this game exists.

This game is a great game to play similar to overwatch but not in the same category, it's really competitive and fun. PEAK

Better than overwatch 2. 
Every hero just holds true to what he/she represents in the comics. 

The game shows the love the devs put behind this. 
Well balanced and there is a hero for everyone to enjoy and learn, without the toxicity and salt that overwatch 2 gives out.

Best hero shooter to come out in a decade

FUN GAME

fuk overwach this game better

It's giving launch Overwatch #1 (A little clunky but good). Has some performance issues that needs to be looked at, but otherwise pretty fine.

yippeeee

[h3] I personal prefer this rather the overwatch[/h3]
lag spike and freeze consistent occupy, you would fly or keeping be teleport back that made you question your life, most of the times you just see the whole battlefield that all the teammates and enemy fought teleport all over the whole map.

the whole heroes pools really contact many classical character in Marvel which sure a nice things, anyway since this game all hero have many skill tree so it sure have the difficult learning curve for sure.

the battle part is intensive, you won't brother to level up that kind of thing, just grab heroes and throw into the battle, without the long boring hit creep this game choice a much faster game play.

great


fun

Actually very fun to play

AGAIN

jeff

It works

Marvel Rivals > Overwatch

buggy and poorly optimised. far better than overwatch and gameplay is very enjoyable-especially being able to do combos and team ups. it needs work but has amazing potential

Game is plagued by afkers, enjoy having your games ruined constantly.   

Is there even a penalty system for afkers?

yes

Guys, this jeff… is ginemenasaurus, whatever you say, gigantasourus, gimenis-ba-menamoris, symenaf morf, gigananorstis… mmhm (It swallowed my entire team)

hehe

This game is so awesome. I love the art, the fit description of all characters from comics to movies, the game play. It's amazing.

if you put aside netease that like shit optimization, the experience of this game is still good. as a shooter in the same genre as OW, i will admit that it is excellent. with the blessing of marvel , i like this game even more, especially the characters such as iron man and spider-man, who are my childhood. finally, i wish this game will get better and better, and i hope there will be more new players to join. so what are you waiting for? why dont you start the game. lol

Jarvis clip that and write ez in chat

better then overwatch 100 percent

It is surprisingly the most fun competitive games, I've had in years

despite my awful pc not running the game well its still so so much fun. I feel like all characters are perfectly balanced bc if everyone is broken no one is broken (apart from iron fist.)

A better OW2

Overwatch but better role que will be good

Fun,Fun,Fun.... Play this not overwatch 2

Very fun, free, addictive and well made


If Overwatch is Thanos, than Marvel Rivals stole the gauntlet from him and snapped their fingers. If you enjoyed Overwatch, then you are about to never hop on that game again.

muito bom, gostei





YES

Pretty solid game compared to OW, Lots of great characters to choose from however mechanics still need some work as its a new game.

Its very fun

this game isnt ballanced at all. also the aiming sens should be set to automatically be something everyone can use.

need the most expensive pc to run this game yes maybe mines old but STILL ITS SO UNPLAYABLE WITH THE AMOUNT ON FRAMES IM GETTING I PLAY HALF THE GAME THINKING IM FIGHTING AND THEN IM GETTING COMPLAINTS FROM TEAMATES SAYING IM STILL IN SPAWN THEN BAM MAGICALLY END UP BACK IN SPAWN WITH GENUINE MINUS FPS I HAVE NOT SEEN DOUBLE DIGITS ON THAT SHEET YET PLEASE

good. I hope its player base will last for years.

Games Buns

Very enjoyable and fun to play. Graphics and gameplay are top-notch.

really, really solid game, but something needs to be done about the tank class. no one wants to play it for good reason, they're all kind of boring. this is coming from a tank main.

Is pretty good, the variety of characters you can play as makes it pretty easy to find a playstyle that suits you. That also means it'll be trial and error for awhile till you find one you can roll with. I also like that if you buy the Season Pass even after it "expires" you are still able to earn the rewards, unlike most other hero shooters XD, The map and character designs are really nice kinda mocking the design of a comic book which fits this style of game very well!
I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes hero shooters and is looking for more variety! (Anyways take care y'all <3)

love it my son loves it

Better than overwatch

Great game, really takes me back as someone with too many hours in overwatch. Does in fact run the risk of getting you into marvel comics though.

literally just a shitty chinese knockoff of overwatch. half the characters are just reskins of overwatch characters same goes for the maps.

Cheat fest like most F2P anti-cheat is useless. great that u can check stats an stuff an see how many folks have 99% accuracy.

i like spiderman

It is SO HARD NOT TO STEAL SOMEONES KILL

Marvel Rivals is absolute madness, and I love it. Imagine your favorite heroes and villains just vibing, then suddenly throwing hands like it’s a superpowered bar fight. Strategy? Who needs it when Moon-Knight's roasting everyone mid battle, and Hulk’s smashing stuff because… well, it’s Hulk.

The fights are wild, the powers are insane, and I’m pretty sure Spider-Man hit me with a web just for standing there. It’s chaotic, it’s hilarious, and honestly, I have no idea what I’m doing but I’m having a blast doing it.


skibidi

fun

i hate this game so buggy crashes everytime i load up the groot skin please if you want to save your soul do not play this game

Amazin

OW but better

Was fun at the beginning but after the christmas update, the server (singapore) started to lag and give very high ping, making me rage. Unplayable game until its fixed.

Nothing bad with game, it just crashes every third match which is very annoying

Unstable and unplayable

Qi guan chang hong!

Worst game i ever played marvel one-liners give me brain damage

Amazing game dude


jeff

Having the same amount of fun since beta. Top tier game!

gud

Great experience and plays great, definitely has performance issues and requires a very good device to play at its full capacity

its good. the game is fun and its easy to pick and hard to master. the battle pass...really look at it and see if its worth it for you. personally i found it lacking.

I never expected a free-to-play game to be this addictive! It’s reminiscent of the original Overwatch, with heroes that are not only fun to play but also have simple designs paired with high skill ceilings. The fact that every hero is available from the start, with no pay-to-win mechanics, is a breath of fresh air in the free-to-play market.

The rounds are fast-paced and fluid, and matchmaking is impressively quick, often taking just a few seconds. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the time I’ve spent in the game so far and find myself completely hooked.

I genuinely hope this game continues to thrive, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh and exciting. Best of all, it’s free, so there’s no reason not to give it a try!

good

limited in some country but good game

It's incredible how well polished the game is.

Animations are sick.
Character designs are on point.
Voice acting is stellar.
Character kits are diverse.
Map design is interesting.

Web swinging is a really jank because how how enviromental design, but i can look past it.

Fun Gameplay, good mechanics. Marvel License is a big plus for fans.

Monetization so far very reasonable.

If you like hero shooters & Marvel, there's literally no reason you shouldn't play imo

Most fun I've hand in a while. Tbh the skins prices are a bit wack if you ask me, but the battlepass in fairly priced and the skins look awesome. Love how easy it is to install mods, since I'm the kind of guy who mods as many games as possible. Hopefully the devs dont do dumb stuff like the overwatch devs did.

good game but it doesn't have goku, love jeff tho

Best hero shooter out there, every champ is well thought off and the game is really fun

Quick play lobbies are filled with bots and worse of all they are mixed with real player.

better version of overwatch


similar to overwatch I like the hitbox here better. I think this game needs role pick for competitve or it will suffer the same fate of overwatch. healer and tank can carry in this game =) would recommend.

very fun but sadly my pc can barely run it


cool

pretty fun hit gold 3 days in just blocking damage with my booty cheeks and eating supports like waffle house streamer caseoh


dog game

best game

One of the funnest multiplayer games I've played in a while. Better than Overwatch on day 1...
This is the game Marvel deserved.

Game always crashes

worst performance i've seen in a game ever. even cyberpunk runs better than this

Best game on the market

Lord star is the goat.

Really fun game to play, many characters to choose from, each for different skill level players, awesome graphics (wouldn't recommend those with lower end devices to play) and yeah overall a really enjoyable game.

I recommend waiting until the game has been optimised, the crashes have been fixed, and the 99% issue has been resolved. Even if it runs fine for you, you'll be put in games with people who are stuck at 99% or are running into walls. It's messy.

shark


everything is perfect except for that dumb shark
ow2 killer

MERICA!

jeff the shark

best game ever ever ever ever

This is just my personal view on this game.
Not a bad game per se but the most of the characters don't really feel interesting or fun in any way to play as or against. Every match feels like a ranked game which sucks for a casual like myself. And I just hate 3rd person shooters. I tried this game and gave it a chance but it just ain't for me.

Amazing fun - loads of heroes to choose from and they are all viable and fun to play!

Чё писать-то, игра хорошая, всё нравится, кто бы что не говорил на ютубе и западе, вполне похвальный балдёж.

gud

On release the game was pretty unbalance and not optimized. It continued this way, no optimization at all. It is unbalanced, some of the heroes are way too under the others, they don't want role queue but the fix you playing certain heroes. Your abilities don't land on your marker, some of the times you see your bullets pass through enemies. Destructibility is not well optimized, you get stucked duo that and get killed. As an honest opininion the game is a cheap rippoff of OW.

shitcomunity with shitplayers

Overwatch could never

Very dynamic and fun game, feels better than other hero-shooters. The third person view helps control the traversal and movement abilities. Marvel themed, so you know what characters you get and what they do. Highly recommend for people who are tired of Overwatch but want a similar experience. Competative MMR feels fair so far, but it still has some server issues and disconnects players after playing several games back to back. Overall highly recommend.

peak game

EAT UR TEAMMATES AS JEFF AND THROW THEM OFF THE LEDGE, ITS REALLY FUNNY!!!!

yes

good

Its pretty cool. Fun times :)

need healers

Game keeps crashing when a match starts. when i get to play the game its very fun but i do not apreciate the messages i get that i might be punished for leaving a match cause YOUR CODE crashes, fix ur shit dont blame me. sometimes i need to restart my pc cause the screen freezes and there is nothing i can do change it except a restart. fix this and i would def play more

jarvis, post a positive review after team wiping with maximum pulse

Fun game, I love it
I wish they fix Frame generation ASAP

better than overwatch 1.5

fire ahh game

..

yes

very very fun

dont play it, they always put the better team and comp on the enemy team..you'll get a decent team once in a blue moon, but they want you to pay alot for skins, these people/ devs are something else..weirdos

it is fun.

ranked fucking sucks

gun game good

w game even with 10 fps

Need friends to play it, Really good game. You'll start loosing after couple of games if you solo

luna snow mod goated

You can play as Spider-Man

Great Gam

GG no heals

Love this game but it crashes too often.

200 hours on this game and diamond 3 in ranked and all I can say is this game is better than overwatch

Best game

The game runs absolutely horribly on a 5700XT while looking like a game from 2006



By the 3rd game you get addicted. YAAAY

its good but there is so many try hards

wewewewe - a loser

SOLO RANK!!!! NO CAP

Shit optimization, should not be running like this on a $1500 gpu. I expected better please stop making games on Ue5 and then blocking engine.ini optimizations so the game can run how it looks, bonus points for the loading screen that gets stuck on 99% for 8 years. Fun game if only it ran well

Fun game, just not playable on PC at the moment. The stutters and FPS drops are killer. Game will freeze for several seconds at a time, depending on map, characters in play, and who's in the lobby. Can play and beat Black Myth Wukong smooth as butter and it's also a recent UE5 game, not sure why this one is performing so horribly. 
Will have to check back in a few months to see if any optimization patch happens. I sure hope it does.

good

great game overwatch killer a lil bug here and there but awsome game play

Great Art style 
cool mechanics
high quality.
one bad thing is that i have 4070ti but i play with HDD and the loadings is disgustingly slow

The game doesn't want to join a match

super fun

The game is awesome

Magik is scary af. Good bye support and back dps. 

[b] ARMED AND DANGEROUS! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! [/b]

no

Overwatch but more fun

Jarvis. Unshit my pants

Iron Man deserves a little more empowerment man !

Until they fix the issue where if someone on your team leaves during a ranked match and you lose points, I can't recommend this game to people. It's not fair to lose progress for others being salty.

Laughable gameplay,
Balance is nowhere to be seen,
Makes no sense how some heroes like Iron Man are able to fly around and do insane damage and melee heroes like Magic can't reach them in any way,
Storm does no damage unlike Iron Man,
Tanks and healers dominate the game.

uteslesia mara chemi dzmakaci sopa sul mtynavs da varageb


Very good

If you've been looking for a replacement for OW, this might be it. It is at least for me.

The gameplay is a little slower-paced, and has just a slight layer of jank to it due to some of the destructible environments (and the shoddy sound effects), but in my opinion offers a lot of what used to make OW so fun, before it became what it is today. Especially with 6v6, team fights are fun and can last a while, instead of one team losing the moment a pick or two happens. 

The heroes are really diverse and fun, and the supports are actually all pretty fun to play (except Adam Warlock, I don't get him). A lot of the abilities are really cool, and the ults are mostly fun to use and I feel like fit the heroes well. Tbh tho the game needs more tanks and supports. There are tons of dmg heroes, and many of them are very fun to play, but there are only a handful of tanks, some of which just aren't that fun. 

It's clear there is a pick-counterpick aspect like there is with OW, though I don't think it's always so obvious who would be well-suited to counterpick some heroes. But it is clear that hero-swapping is a core mechanic of the game, and should be used liberally when dying frequently in a match. Stubbornly continuing with a team comp that just isn't working is the downfall of many teams in this game. I like that this game makes recommendations on what hero picks it thinks you should make, and doesn't really seem to enforce any kind of "2-2-2" comp or anything, which is refreshing (I found the game recommending duelist when there was only a single tank).

I do think the cosmetics are CRAZY over-priced, and the progression on the battlepass is a bit slow, and the multi-currency thing is just annoying. I can overlook that stuff however, because the game is free, and I haven't felt compelled to spend any amount of money on buying currency, except to buy the season 0 battlepass. I'll probably continue to buy the battlepasses going forward, but don't plan to spend any additional money on skins. They're just too expensive.

But if you can look past that and just focus on the gameplay, this game is worth your time. It's a lot of fun, and I imagine I'll probably sink a ton of hours into it like I did with OW. Plus there's basically a limitless pool of awesome heroes for them to pull from for future updates, so I feel like this one will be around for a while. Definitely recommend!

iron fist when i catch you...

I'm writing this review on the sliver of hope that one of the developers sees it. Thank you for not nerfing Jeff despite all the sweaty tryhards hating on him. Please continue to prioritize the quiet majority of your player base over the loud minority that doesn't understand how to hold S for literally two seconds to avoid the most dodgeable ult in the game!

Honestly an amazing game. IF you have the specs for it, because apparently an i7 12th gen, 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1660ti aren't enough for this game. 0-13 fps in a normal game is actually insane. The game looks extremely promising, its like a ten times better version of Overwatch. Yet the optimization for this game isn't good at all. I spawned in when the match was already going on for 1m 30s. Uninstalling for now, maybe in the future when I get more RAM and a better gpu I'll give it a second try.

playable shark

Hero shooter genre's last hope.

much better than OW

Brian was very disrespectful to the team while playing. We were carrying his e-girl ass while he complained about comp and bad coms. Its Overwatch all over again. Brians the new Nintendo. Fuck Nintendo.

so much better then overwatch

The Only hero shooter which I genuinely had fun Playing

iron fist needs a nerf stat..

good game

very nice game

As someone who loves Marvel and used to love Overwatch, this game is the best of both worlds. And for a free game, it's very good.

nice

lets see how long the good times last


It's fking good.

Better than ow2

im hulking out irl

Delicious cakes!

Stop comparing Marvel Rivals to Overwatch, you're confusing Overwatch for a good game like Marvel Rivals


Overwatch 101

Very fun game, but poor optimization and issues with connecting to matches.

HEALING IS OVERPOWERED!!! +100 +100 +100 +50 +50

good

its a carry your team or get steamrolled simulator. they need to fix the matchmaking certain ppl should not be allowed to play competitive games

MARVEL + OVERWATCH = BETTER OVERWATCH

Dont play this game its to hard

‎

good shit

100 times better than overwatch now. All the characters are op but that what makes it fun. Since they are all busted it makes it fair honestly. Been non-stop playing since it came out

game is an apsolute blast, it's fun as fuck, anyone who is thinking of playing it should try it. fr the best game I played in a long time. Only bad thing I have to say about it is rn, that the optimazation is shit. I hope they will fix it, it's gonna be so much better. that's it, if you want to try it, just go and play, see for yourlsef

me like game. me punchy with iron fist

sadly much better than overwatch ... ;-;

First hero shooter for me as I never really connected to Overwatch. This is very fun

Honestly I just love having a wide selection of characters that feel different in mechanics but same function. the combo traits are a very welcome add on and i really hope they just continue to add more champions, mainly healers and tanks which is half the amount of the available dps. no loot boxes per level currently and matches feel quick so if you get crammed with a bad team and get pinned in spawn its only a few moments in que till the next match. That and i feel with both the weekly challenges and daily passes resetting so quickly its easy to complete their passes

Game is absolute dog shit, crashes randomly for no reason, and penalizes you for it. Pc is well past the recommendation specs, the game just decides that you dont get to play. STAY ON OVERWATCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/3 STARS  
1/10 STARS
1/100 STARS. IT WILL BE THE LOWEST SCORE ON ANY SCALE

Gaem Good

GREAT GAME FREE SHIT AND GREAT MECHANICS BOUGHT A SKIN TO SUPPORT CAUSE GAMES NEED TO BE LIKE TJIS

Fun Gameplay.
Cool voice lines. (Especially Ironman)
Well designed maps.
Matchmaking has balance issues but they will fix it. (I hope)
Heros are pretty good balanced too. (imo) (Some can say Iron fist is op, that's halfly true but you can easily counter him with Hawkeye's Shift + Double Jump + Triple Arrow, Ironman and Wolverine can counter him pretty easily too. Mantis' shift is effective too )
Let's hope this game does not face the same fate as Overwatch.

lkjhgblk


pls dont pla yyou will run it on 20 to 30 fps max


GOOD

Good game, play every day.

Paladins on Steroids


I'm addicted to it

While the game itself is nice, it's just awfully optimized and crashes constantly on me despite using high end hardware. I've seen others have this issue, and I don't think the devs are focused on finding solutions.

marvel studios budget goes stoopid

Ban these players LOL. So lame to have a 0/20 dude running it down in COMP. Its COMP and I've played League ranked for a decade. I will troll if you want to! energy matched. If you are trying to lose because of the premade lobby chat. LOSER BEHAVIOR IMO.

[h3]Final Rating: 7.5/10[/h3]

Fun game. I enjoy ranked. But the game is not optimized, at all. Not for low end PC's, not for mid not for high. Its just random bs go. Some get fps some don't. This christmas update dunked on my fps + not letting ppl modify the config made it even worse. I was getting like 150fps with the config. Now it goes down to like 50 fps and you move awful in teamfights. You can't be a competitive game and not run well on most setups.

fun

Marvel Rivals is so much more than an "Overwatch clone." It brilliantly brings together heroes and villains from across Marvel’s universe, staying true to their character designs and abilities. The decision to make this a third-person game is genius—while I usually prefer first-person, the perspective fits perfectly here. It allows for more dynamic combat and situational awareness, and honestly, first-person would’ve taken away from the experience.

One of the standout features is the destructible environments. Whether you’re creating new pathways, sneaking around holes in walls, or taking down entire buildings, the destruction adds so much to the strategy and fun of the game. It feels chaotic in the best way, making every battle feel alive.

What really sets Marvel Rivals apart is how much respect the developers have for each character. I’ll admit, I had my doubts going in, but it’s clear this game was made by true Marvel fans. Swinging and zipping through the map as Spider-Man genuinely makes you feel like the web-slinger, while soaring as Iron Man and blasting enemies with repulsors or his Unibeam is just as thrilling. Each character plays exactly how you’d expect, staying faithful to their abilities and personality, which makes the gameplay even more immersive.

On top of that, the addition of team-up abilities is just genius. Coordinating with your team or friends to unleash combined powers brings a whole new level of excitement. It’s not just about individual skill—it’s about teamwork and strategy, which makes every match feel like an epic Marvel moment.

Another cool feature is the seasonal buffs for different characters. It keeps things fresh and adds a layer of strategy to picking your roster. The fact that the developers clearly communicate which characters are buffed is a big plus in my book—it shows they care about keeping the game balanced and engaging.

From a technical perspective, Marvel Rivals absolutely nails it. The game worked perfectly on day one, which is almost unheard of these days. There are no queue times when searching for a match—none. You click “Find Match,” and poof, you’re in. It’s a level of speed and efficiency I’ve rarely seen in online games. The matchmaking system also lets you choose which servers to search for matches in, showing your ping for each one. Plus, it displays connection bars for everyone in your party, so you can easily find the best server for your team. These thoughtful details make for an incredibly smooth experience.

The characters are mostly overpowered, which is incredibly fun, though some could use a few nerfs or buffs to balance things out. But the low time-to-kill (TTK) is a refreshing change compared to games like Overwatch. It makes the combat feel fast, intense, and incredibly satisfying.

The battle pass system deserves special mention. Once you buy a pass, it’s yours forever—there’s no time limit to grind through it, which is exactly how battle passes should be done. It’s a player-friendly system that respects your time and investment, and I wish more games would adopt it.

Visually, the game is stunning. The art style captures the Marvel universe beautifully while still feeling unique. Every character design I’ve seen is amazing, and the skins they’ve released are fantastic. Yes, they’re a little overpriced, but since the game is free-to-play, it’s understandable that this is how they fund ongoing development.

Overall, Marvel Rivals has become my new go-to competitive game. With its destructible environments, true-to-character gameplay, team-up abilities, smooth launch, instant matchmaking, and thoughtful systems like the battle pass, it feels like a love letter to Marvel fans. I can’t wait to see what the developers have in store for the future.

i dont like competitive game but this game is worth to try..

Ban every single middle eastern brown skinned t a r d s please no one likes them, they smell like shit and suck at the game

As you can see by the play time this is a really game of all time.

The only thing that would improve it is limitations on how late you can join a game. I shouldn't que into a game with >5 seconds left.

Once I joined a game with 1 second left before my team lost.

game has my nuts quakin

This game would be great if you had to pay for it, but the fact that it is free makes it even more amazing. I wish there were more maps but I'm sure they'll add them in later. Worth a try if you like competitive multiplayer games.

This game is sigma, skibidi and Got 10000000000009000000003671 aura

great game

its fun but there are some characters that is annoying

The first time in a long time I've had this much fun playing something online with all my buddies!

WAY WAY WAY better then OW. W game

The game is lots of fun, with a lot of character diversity when it comes to uniqueness and abilities. Since it is still quite in its early stages, it needs more content. I would say the game is a step-up in the genre but needs more maps, characters and modes.

better than O_W

jarvis, clip that

yeah....

At first glance, Marvel Rivals has everything I would want from a hero shooter. A world I already know from movies, series and comics. Mechanics that are fun and catchy and the ability to destroy certain parts of the map!

The idea is really nice, but the performance just ruins everything. I don't have a bad PC and yet this game runs like ass. High ping, bad input delay and horrible FPS. 

Until the developers address the problems, I can't recommend this game to anyone!

everything good except for jeff i want that shark DEAD.

better overwatch

great game
\


good game

Very reminiscent of Overwatch 1 when it first came out before it fell into meta balance hell. 
Very nice menu and ui 
Awesome roster....besides a couple....odd ones
There are also destructible environments and boosts to your characters when you team up certain heros
which are unique features to rivals that  really add to the game
Overall it is just pure fun. 

It might someday fall to the same fate OW1 did but theres so much NetEase is doing right it's hard not to have some faith. Only time will tell...

i HATE SPIDERMAN MAINS

this is so peak...

just please nerf scarlet witch she's the most braindead character imaginable

Have you seen the ass on Venom?

This game makes me want to hurt people in real life

Very nice

better than overwatch

Great Fun Game!
Nerf Iron Fist

game fucking sucks

frustrating and a large skill ceiling 10/10

It's Overwatch... but GOOD. some characters are a little over tuned, but it's wildly fun overall.

PEAK

Might have been a good game but its filled with 50% of useless characters and 50% of broken ones and nothing changes. Its always a bad sign. Another game with good promise and 0 balance

Incredible game. If you are into Overwatch, but 10x better and more mechanically advanced, then this is for you :D



Fun but crashes way more than it should and penalises you for leaving the game ON QUICK PLAY

Me like shoot with PunisHer and watch Luna Snows cheeks while she skates/glides very nice game :)

I love the gameplay but this game's busted to all hell. Can't play for even 30 min without my friend crashing. We played during the beta and he had no issues but suddenly the game doesn't work on release. Add on top that it takes ages to preload shaders, and you can barely even get back into a game after you get disconnected. Fix the game.

i hate iron fist

like Overwatch, but fun!

Feels a lot more rewarding to play than overwatch. Unique characters actually have unique abilities unlike overwatch where they nerfed every character to be bare bones for balance purposes. Not only the game, characters feel a lot more rewarding to play and feel impact full

the better (and cooler) overwatch

what a fun and addictive game. so much fun to play. would recommend to all.

FUN


I LOVE JEFF THE LAND SHARK!!!!

-Abuse Winter Soldiers ultimate on my first game
-Never play another character
-Tries other characters
-Go negative
-Go back to WS

gas

Me when I marvel at my rivals

this game is literally unplayable due to performance issues. most horribly optimized game ive ever seen. even with 2 performance mods I can't load into a match before it starts.

i like this game and would love to actually be able to play it

good corn

peak 
runs great

Its like Overwatch if it was good

My biggest nightmare is hearing "AGAIN!" after this game

Yes, better than OW, and better videos to come

Good game but better version of Overwatch 🤡

PROS-
-Really Fun Cast with great abilities
-Monetization is not the worst ive seen (low bar)
-Reporting system actually seems to work (im shocked)

CONS-
-Still getting crashes pretty consistently in my game (always 
Marvel_Win64_Shipping
kernel32
ntdll

still waiting on a patch, did everything on my end)
-Competitive mode is a toxic cesspool (standard)

i love jeff

Very fun gameplay

Better than OW2

very very fun

MARVEL RIVALS

I AM GAY I LIKE THIS GAME I AM AN INCEL WITH NO FRIENDS THIS GAME IS MY LYFE

My biggest contention with the game is that there is no role que. Its very frustrating to try and climb when everyone wants to play dps. I play support most of the time. It just feels impossible to try and do my best when i have a team of 5 dps characters all expecting me to heal them at all times. The people in my play group dont like the idea of role que bc it would make que times go up, however I personally really dont mind waiting an extra minute to play the game if it means that my gameplay experience is better. I can lose a match knowing that we just got outplayed. I can't lose knowing the reason we lost was simply in champ select due to people being hard headed. I really hope its a function they implement in the future

pretty fun

hulk smash

Its a great game and by season 1 will already have more characters than Overwatch 2 Its very fun and I totally recommend people to get this its overall quality and feel to the game just is really nice plus there is not a lot of bugs in the game.

The characters and the maps looks good and the game play was fun so play it, it Better then Overwatch 2 slob.

Do you like playing without a team? Then this is the game for you, 4 dps and 1 healer every game, this is the game for you. Playerbase is bad, community is toxic as bad if not worse than league.







not bad

this game is too laggy, otherwise it's 10/10 but this lag makes it unplayable. its not my internet or ping, my fps cant handle all the animations constantly being made so i die at crucial moments causing me to lose games. my graphics are already at the lowest possible settings and my pc is pretty good. i also dont have any other programs open so i know its not that.

very fun

Psylocke second skin

i want venoms 19 inches

very fun even for casuals 


Amazing game! Like overwatch but better! Even better with friends too! I love the roster of characters and the details of them along with the variety of maps there are in the game and expect to see alot more to keep the game ever so expanded and fresh,

you can put me down but i always get back up 
                                    
                                                   -sincerely - 0/23 Wolverine (me)

If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the Devil, and the kids keep comin'
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young
But I tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do at night
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
My love is the evenin' breeze touchin' your skin
The gentle, sweet singin' of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine
Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Wild man's world is cryin' in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?
Ooh, crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
I was a willow last night in a dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
Sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love
Crazy
Yeah, crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

TLDR: I'm literally Adam Warlock

Game is great when it works, but it's poorly optimized. I have consistent crashing, and no suggestions on the FAQ help.

AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN!

Overall the game is good I mean if your playing to be casual yes its really good. But in the comp side unless you just got a 6 man to run with is awful.

Never played a hero shooter before, but got pulled into this one by word of mouth from a friend. Really glad they did as this game has really grabbed my attention.

l

my name jeff

most rage inducing game, horrible and toxic community. pure ass

Very good game when it works. When i first downloaded the game close to release, it worked fine for ages. No lag issues or crashes. Then this past 2 weeks ish it has become unplayable. I've not changed anything on my pc and yet it now lags at least a little every game. And when its at its worst, im frozen between lags for up to 20 seconds, then im able to play a few seconds of game before it lags again or crashes completely and closes the game. By the time i re-launch im getting penalties for leaving early. It must be the game thats the issue, due to the fact it worked fine for a good while. And it seems like other people have had the same issue. I hope it gets fixed soon :)

Long time lover of OW2 despite its many flaws. This game is so much better. Sick artstyle, well rounded heroes, no bugs whatsoever. Judging by the leaks they also have a lot more stuff cooking. Hard reccomend!

Good Lord I haven't enjoyed coop this much since... Overwatch 1.

Excellent guys! Let's play!

frustrating as fuck but better than overwatch

VERY FUN

Check how many times Overwatch appears in the reviews.

Best (and only) hero shooter I played. Needs some optimization and balance changes.

amazing, just amazing. the whole game is amaiznig mabye there is too many options for getting wrecked but its so much fun.

Awesome game!!

Screen started to stutter a lot with the new updates.

fun :)

not pay to win 10/10

Really good hero shooter


A new contender to Overwatch.
Looks good
Cool characters
Cute shark dog
I like healing
Free
everyone is overpowered, so no one is overpowered, It's a delicate balance
Gameplay is solid
I had smooth gameplay. 
Again, free. Give this one a try. You'll thank me.

ye

The game is amazing! 
It's great to have fun from time to tima and it also has depth for people who wanna sink time into the game.
Overall 10/10

Hulk Tuah 👍

opened the game to go 1-26 to a hela loki and mantis i dont think this is a good game i dont think its my fault whatsoever it is completely an issue with the game itself and this game is bad and there should be an option to remove clothing pieces from characters this is unrelated dont worry about that but this game does no truly reflect my skill level as a pro gamer and so this game is awful. my review is completely objective and nonbiased, and there is aboslutely no room for refutation. thank you.

goood

I love the game a lot. So many characters feel very fun to play and theirs definitely a character for everyone who wants to play. their is some toxic people in the game but their mostly in the ranked mode but you don't have to play that if you don't want to.

better than overwatch

woof

This will never be a gem

This is COAL.

great game similar to overwatch but much more fun

better that overwatch and lol

The community for this game is already toxic. to get out of the lower ranks without a stacked team is impossible with how many people afk and throw or just disconnect. free games bring the most disrespectful and difficult people to play with

Great game!


ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS PSYLOCKE'S GYATT

So much better than Overwatch.

40% overwatch 60% sex appeal

If you see this, uninstall overwatch and be happy.

JEFF THE LANDSHARK, IRON FIST, IRON MAN RAHHHHHHHHHHH

better than overwatch 10/10 would reccomend

No complaints honestly. It's fun when every character is broken.

Absolute Cinema!!

Overwatch 6/10

I liked Marvel Rivals because every character feels unique, keeping the game fresh. I also really enjoyed the fact that there are different skill-cap characters that make it easy to navigate and choose a character to play. Along with the destructive map, it's easily overtaken Overwatch.

Marvel Rivals Review: Great Fun, but Hawkeye Needs a Nerf

Marvel Rivals is undeniably fun, with engaging gameplay and plenty of action-packed moments. However, there's one glaring issue that dampens the experience: Hawkeye.

The character is completely overpowered. Every arrow feels like a guaranteed headshot, no matter where it lands. Miss high? Headshot. Hit the body? Headshot. Shoot two feet below me while I’m airborne? Somehow still a headshot. It’s absurd.

Every lobby is dominated by players picking Hawkeye, making matches feel more like a survival challenge against his broken mechanics than a balanced competition. It’s frustrating to the point that I’ve decided to step away from the game until the developers address this issue.

Marvel Rivals has a ton of potential, but for now, it’s tough to enjoy when one character throws the entire balance off. Here’s hoping for a patch soon, because this could be a truly great game.

So far so good

FUN WITH VARIABLE TEAM COMPOSITIONS MAKE FOR DYNAMIC GAME INTERACTIONS AND TEAM FIGHTS ALLOW FOR GAMES TO FEEL DIFFERENT EACH GAME

need more variations of Psylocke og costume

you can play as loki and thor so yeah

Could have been fun but sadly bot filled game.

Great game, fun easy graphics, fun hero abilities, short games.

Hot Sh!t

I am so glad there is no LGBTFQ+ shit.

Time to get sticky!

its so sigma

Wild to see a game release with stable servers, little queue times, relatively balanced and fun.

This last update is causing system issues though which seems to be getting worse? I was just desktop crashing after 6-7 games, then its become a hard freeze where I cant open task manager and recently at the end of the game had a complete system shut down with system error. Really decent PC and this is the only game I have issues with.

Jeff :D

Very thick

goated sause


Playing from Japan the ping is horrible, they lost me as a player not because the game isn't fun but because I can not get into any game with decent ping that stay consistent throughout the length of the match. I have 30/40 ping  on the Tokyo sever and 120 ping on the Singaporean server in menu, yet in game both severs shoot up to 500/600 ping  all throughout the match, I haven't played a single match where I was able to enjoy the entirety of the match.

If they fix the issue, I would definitely return as a player but for now, Its a on the back burner game.

dawdaw

spibnerman

its cool like Overwatch's cousin

top ten game on steam fr fr


Notice that I have 1 hour on record. In that one hour, I have gotten as far as the epilepsy warning on the loading screen.
I don't have bad specs by any means, now. It's just that AAA studios these days think everyone has a $20k gaming PC, so they shove as much bloatware into their games as possible, and tell the rest of us to get bent. Definitely the best waiting simulator I've played, though.

discount overwatch with even less balance

<3

Very good game, with lots of attention to detail. The only negative things that I have to say is the presence of Star Lord as he is annoying. Thank you for reading my review.

nice game, but make Magik better

This is an absolutely amazing hero shooter.

Reminds me of the good old days of OG Overwatch, great time.

(P.S. hope my boy Daredevil gets added.)

Solid game. Definitely better then any experience I've had on other similar games.

hawkeye is better than all your mains


It good

Amazing new hero shooter made with passion. Thankfully, it's not just another soulless cash grab.

I love getting railed by venom!!!!

Amazing game with a lot of potential. Blows Overwatch out of the water in every way, especially just at launch. more content the better, we need more maps, modes, and a steady flow of heroes.

It's soooo fun! Old Overwatch days fun. Seamless launch too. Pretty impressive! The cash shop is there but are just cosmetic skins. A++++

Marvel Overwatch that is so much better than Overwatch!

mid

played 2 matches so far, very good game, would be better if my friends were on but still a great game.

AGAIN!

shit

better then overwatch and alot more fun!

cool


shark go squirt

Nice

Team says "GG no heal" despite me healing them

The players are complete donkey. The ranked system is absolutely dog water. EVERYONE starts at Bronze 3. Which means as you coin flip your way through the ranks. You either gonna have a monkey thats actually Bronze 3 or a Plat OW Player thats Bronze 3. The matches are extreme coinflip. Characters are completely unbalanced. Its the FOMO right now, but this game will fall off. Trust me. You will have a better time playing League of Legends or something

very fun

It's better than the last Hero Shooter I played


Very destructible environments, over 30+ characters, a focus on team play with synergy bonuses, and a very flexible battlepass system. I say it's one of the best hero shooters out there if not the best of the sort 👍🏿

fun fun fun fun GYATT

this game is really fun and i really like the game

hero shooter :v

It has a shark with feet... Whats not to like...

Jeff

im gonna fucking say it and i play both of these games, overwatch is unironically better then this duct taped ass of a game. very bad balancing overall, even MORE overpowered support heros than overwatch, a painfully average frame rate compared to overwatch (for reference, my computer can ow at 300fps+ on ultra 1440p settings, while this game is only 160fps on MEDIUM???), crashes at the worst fucking times, feels incredibly mushy and unsatisfying. making me consider giving blizzard money LOL

Me likey

epic

better than overwatch pretty aight


Fun team-based hero shooter.  Much like Paladins, it offers a unique take on this genre.  Great synergy with characters and loads of fun gameplay for days to come!  So far no wide swing updates/changes which is how fps style games should be!

This game crashes so often for soo many people, it is every 2-3 matches for me

is good

ples make graphic more lower so dat i can play with mor fps make it 2d idc as long i get mor fps

Its alright don't expect a serious game

better than Overwatch 10 full

Very poor optimized, bad balancing and no charisma at all, everything feels hollow, no impact, nothing.

Maybe it is in the right track, but for now, no.

good,

W game

Its like a new reason to hate yourself 10/10

bom jogo

gud

Game is re-skinned Overwatch which is not bad in itself however the cross play in competative where consoles can get aim assist is massively unbalanced. I would play but not spend any money definatly would not be supporting this game financially until they resolve the matchmaking and also there is a lot of Aimbots in general which is very noticable on replays. not enough is done to ban these players

Amazing game play and great community. Blizzard blows.

sick shit

BERSERKER RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEEEEEEEEEE

sucks azzz masssive stink


funnest 6v6 game ive ever played

Fun time with the friendo's

good game

nice


This game isnt overwatch therefore its great.



squirrels girl and psylockes ass


got yelled at for complaining about my mercy not healing in qp what a joke

PLAY


this game sucks so much ass i cant wait for it to die

Absolute garbage. Game crashes every other match. I followed the game's instructions to fix the crashes but it didn't work. On top of that, sometimes after it crashes I can't rejoin the match because I get replaced by another player even though I tried to rejoin instantly. Terrible game.

I fucking hate jeff

Mmmmmmmmm

Just pure fun

Fun game learning mnk for the first time and I am having a blast

Cant wait for the r34!!!

as bad as overwatch is its better

After Overwatch 2 completely dropped the ball, it felt like the hero shooter genre was on life support. Then Marvel Rivals showed up and reminded everyone how good these games can be.

The game launched with 33 heroes, and each one feels unique and fun to play. Even the most unbalanced heroes, whether they feel a little too strong or slightly underpowered, just need a small nudge in the right direction. Nothing feels outright broken, which is impressive for a game of this scale right out of the gate. The gameplay is fast, fun, and incredibly polished for such a new release.

The Winter Celebration event adds a lot to enjoy, with fresh missions and festive content that make the game feel alive during the season. It’s a fun addition that rewards players without feeling grindy or overwhelming.

What really sets Marvel Rivals apart is how respectful it is to its players. The battle pass is extremely fair. You can keep progressing it even after the season ends, which takes away the pressure to grind or rush. Microtransactions are purely cosmetic, so nothing feels pay-to-win, and the focus stays on having fun.

Marvel Rivals is exactly what the hero shooter genre needed. It’s polished, well-balanced, and exciting, with plenty of potential for the future. If you’re into hero shooters, this one’s worth your time.

The only thing Netease did not copy from Overwatch was optimization. The experience playing this game is abhorrent. I am tired of all the UE5 garbage cobbled from spaghetti code that has been recently released. Rather than creating a well developed game they expect you to brute force their junk to run at all.

I like Thicc Squirrels. 

Please stop asking me to rate the game.

game fun but getting out of bronze 3 is the most awful, painful, anger inducing thing ever. ranked is the mosst scuffed thing ever

Lots of characters to pick from, all different. solid game thus far.

baka

Better overwatch



Better than Overwatch

What if Overwatch 2 was worse

One of the most fun games I've played in the last decade. It took the blueprint from Overwatch and blew it out of the water.

I messed with the gyats and The jeff.

I goon to this game

game

The game is fun. But man for a game with kinda like mobile games graphic, the optimization should have been better.. sometimes its locked to 60 fps i dunno why. Please fix this optimization issue ASAP.

Mid

Overwatch died so Marvel Rivals could fly

I know you want to DON'T PLAY SPIDER-MAN. That outta the way, this game is awesome, its free, it's pretty, its simple, has all your favourite Marvel characters and will make you fall in love with Jeff the Shark.

Better then OW for now

good

Good

The game is a straight up copy of OW2
There's constant crashing that they haven't been able to fix yet
There is no role queue, so that means every game is a coin flip
If someone isn't healing your team won't even get out of the spawn
I've been on both sides where I couldn't leave my spawn because of the team comp and games where I did it to enemies
The main reason is the game is designed around having tanks, healers and dps
Nearly every game starts with people instantly locking their character and will refuse to fill
So every time you queue, you just flip a coin whether your team is going to cooperate and work together, or you have toxic idiots who would rather lose while playing poorly than swap characters
That's how every game I've played has gone since I started ranking up
I made it to Gold 1 and its just too much of a coin flip to enjoy playing 
The devs also refuse to add role queue, so its like old old Overwatch, which had such a big issue they added role queue
Which is what literally every competitive moba/hero shooter has now... 
So between the crashing, balance issues on characters, and no role queue
No, I do not recommend it till they change the game

Fire ah game tbh

my name is kira yoshikage, i am 33 years old...

Smells like ice cream

The best hero shooter try it, and you will never regret it, Great job to the studio that created this masterpiece. I hope it stays with us for a long time and continues supporting the game and community to make it even better.

Super fun, great art style, lots of characters with different play styles; This free game will keep you playing!

good

nice

I defended this game since day one of the trailer, all the way through its beta tests, and now, all my energy spent into this game that meshes my hyperfixations wasn't for nothing.
It's great. It's the perfect antithesis to a game like Overwatch. Playfully chaotic, everyone is broken, and it's characters you recognize (and probably care about). The game launch was smooth and the vibes have been high all the time.

One main issue: optimization. You will most likely run into game crashes and server lag. It's happened to everyone. Doesn't matter what your PC specs are. I don't know if the devs will fix it, but that's like the only issue so far, minus a few rare glitches.

Please give the game a shot. It's free to play, it's a hero shooter, it's an "everyone is broken so it's balanced" type of playstyle. It'll be hot on the charts for a bit now, so why not see what the fuss is about.

The best hero shooter of recent history. From good visuals, both iconic and niche heroes, abilities with amazing feel, as well as a community guided focus from the developers (rather than a competitive focus like so many failed hero shooters went for), Marvel Rivals is worth your time. My only gripe is with the cost of the cosmetic store.

ditched Overwatch 2 for Rivals. 10/10 would ditch Overwatch 2 again.

GYAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

WAY BETTER THEN OVER WATCH 2 ID RECOMMEND THIS OVER THAT TRASH OF A GAME!!

GAME CRASHES ALL THE TIME. I CAN NOT PLAY FOR 2 HOURS WITHOUT THE GAME CRASHING MULTIPLE TIMES. AND THEN I GET A WARNING FOR LEAVING THE GAME. FIX YOUR GAME.

just been laggy no matter what even when all my other online games working just fine this one seems to not work at all

is good

better overwatch

best game ive played in a while

iron man missiles go brrr

Rivals is amazeballs and it's gonna replace the old nonsense like OW cuz 2 tanks is better than 1!

Fun game and feels very fast and fluid

Cool Strong

This game is just pure fun! Especially for those who are sick of Overwatch. The game released very polished, no issues. It's how a game in 2024 should be on release..no hotfix/patches needed. 
Freaking Jeff ult man...lol

Highly recommend! Have fun!

Better COD WZ, Apex Legends....

i am so good at thor

I don't really get the hype. Feels bloated and not optimised whatsoever; and now they are adding bots to multiplayer matches.

"Jarvis, uninstall overwatch"

I have a decent pc specs, R5 5600g paired with rtx 2060, with 16gb of ram and 1tb ssd. But I kept on getting 4fps - 1 fps per game, I tried all the yt vids about optimizing this game so that I can play, none works

Very Marvel! Very Rival!

Major balancing issues with the characters, but it's their first season so I won't hold it up as a bad thing. *Yet*. Otherwise it's a fun game if you're not too invested in this game. There are a lot of problems with team comp games to attract fun into their game. Overall I would recommend if you're just looking to play casually, would not recommend if you're looking for a competitive experience.

BEST GAME ON THE MARKET


CRACKED OUT OVERWATCH HOLY SHIT MY BRAIN HAS NEVER GAINED SO MUCH DOPAMINE OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG

yes

Keep just adding in fun. Let the new ultron take over Ironman for all I care, it's a game.  It's fun because there isn't just a bunch of lame nerfs.

Stability is surprisingly good with how new it is, but ive had a couple rare crashes and stutters.

I didn't think it was possible, but this game is better than Overwatch and I have thousands of hours in Overwatch.

Act like an angel and dress like crazy - Luna Snow



fun

The Bees Knees

the game is mildly fun, i found it to basically be a remix of overwatch, however the load times are egregious. it can take minutes for just the map to load leaving you on the loading screen with nothing to do but listen to the round starting as you wait, and if you force quit the game you will receive a penalty for leaving an in progress match rather than leaving your team down 1 or more teammates. and even if you get in you'll have to again wait for the characters to load, which can take long enough that you are left to vaguely shoot towards the enemy as no character models have loaded yet

and this is with the game installed on an m.2 ssd

until this is fixed i cannot recommend this game

i dont necessarily NOT recommend this game (its obviously worth the free price tag) but i dont believe it deserves the endless praise it’s been getting. i also dont see it having any sort of actual lifespan like other free pvp games look to have
it’s a fun time for a little bit. the characters are mostly unique and feel nice to play. maps are mostly without issues and the destruction mechanic is cool. balance could be better but its not usually a problem. however the devs were so bent on everything being brainlessly easy (except spider-man for whatever reason) that the lack of skill expression and learning curve makes it unfathomably boring to continue to play. also the ‘everyone is broken so nobody is broken’ fallacy only takes you so far. 
i think rivals is very much a ‘flavor of the month’ type of game and there appears to be no effort from the devs to change that

Game is good but, freeplay is INFESTED with hackers. they really need to up their anticheat, if you play ranked tho your good but not everybody can handle ranked so the majority of the playerbase exprience hackers :(

gud addikted

it's just overwatch but actually fun again :)

FUEGO

better than OW for sure

This game has only been out for 3 weeks and I already have people telling me to kill myself. Don't bother with this.

The art style and dialog in this game are really fun. Playing with random people who may or not be complete jerks isn't great, but if you have a whole team of actual friends, this is a fun time.

OOGHHH PSYLOCKE...

some champs need nerfs but good game

Great game, but it crashes every 4-5 games for me. Not ideal when playing competitive

n1ts

The recommended settings for my computer are all maxed out but the game runs at such a low frame rate, it is as if i am watching a power point presentation. I have tried every setting, every driver, every game in my library. The issues lies with Marvel Rivals. I log in every few days hoping that they will fix the game but today I am giving up. I would recommend against playing this game, not for its questionably balanced characters, limited map pool, or abhorrent monetization scheme, but for its inability to perform under the most forgiving settings.

better

this game rules i wish sharks were real

It's just overwatch again. Oh, there are some fun characters with neat gimmicks like flight or such, but its still just overwatch, except now there seems to be little to no balancing, both in heroes and matchmaking. Expect every match to be a one sided stomp one way or the other, as well as some heroes being several times stronger than similar counterparts. It's fine, it might even be fun for a few months while its got a new burst of player activity, but the lack of hero balance is going to prove very frustrating after a few matches.

i hate jeff so much if you play him i dispise you too

Hela is hella devious

AMAZING

jarvis leave a good review

Marvel Overwatch Slop. I can see how it got a lot of attention, but it's probably going to be a flash in the pan. It really just serves as a reminder at how badly Blizzard mishandled Overwatch. 

The gameplay feels stiff. I'm not sure if it has matchmaking in the casual mode. I stomped a few lobbies and found myself losing games where I went 46-5, so it at least feels like it is doing the classic thing these games do where they try and hamfist "fair" matches. 

Honestly, it's really nothing special. If it wasn't an established IP I doubt it would be doing numbers. I'm a certified Marvel hater, so I can't see myself actually playing this for the game itself.

I'M ADDICTED

To keep it short, this game is everything I've ever loved about Overwatch back in the peak (2016-2018) days of that game. It's got its fair share of issues, mostly in the optimization and hero balance department, since it's relatively new and will need time to settle, but at it's core, it's incredibly fun and interesting. The characters are done justice and the art style & visuals are superb. 
To anyone looking for a solid, modern, fresh take on a hero shooter? This is it.

Dopamine Farm

This game lowk goated

Feels of how overwatch felt when it first came out, before it turned into the dogshit it is today.

great game, lotsa fun characters, very addicted very quickly XD ive alrdy spent almost 100$ on skins

love this game

It's a genuinely good game its got some rough around the edges alot of broken characters and abilities. It also suffers with the same awful community that plagues all games like this I really think it needs a role queue but this has become less of a problem as I've climbed higher around High Plat to Low Diamond I've noticed is when people don't just instalock 4dps. Some heroes are straight busted tho like Hela and Hawkeye (Which is why they usually get insta-banned) and some supports are just useless compared to the likes of Luna and Mantis. I think it's got alot of potential and scratches that OW1 itch more than OW2.

I love this game so much I cried

you know the game is good when you see the Overwatch gooners start switching to this. Also, where is superwoman, batgirl and nightwing ?

 Jeff

yes

Better than OW, I can put that on everybodies lives.

very good

fun

I wanted to enjoy it, but just can't.  Between a lack of role queue (so DPS gets insta-locked, so anyone who cares gets stuck on vanguard or strategists, and usually locked by multiple people who go 0-20) that means you don't get to play what you want if you care about winning (e.g. competitive to get the skin) and ridiculous lack of balancing as highlighted by this idiotic winter event with Jeff, it just isn't fun.  I've found myself mostly playing bot matches to clear the missions I don't even want to do, but have to if I want rewards (because of course you can't reward just playing), so why continue?

As an example of balancing: Jeff can swallow the enemy team for something like ten seconds and KO them all.  Even if you're outside the animation, even if you're flying.  He also can self heal quickly while being a small target.  As compared to Storm who can... lightly tickle people.  Or Rocket Racoon who can... crawl on walls?  Throw in seasonal buffs that make it worse, and, meh.

Everything Overwatch 2 should've been.

As a spidey main this game is good but need more healers, i keep dying when flaking aint my fault my team is not behind me they have to follow me cuz ofc spidey da GOAT, but other wise 10/10
also f you jeff you annoying little cute bastard

Peak game, overwatch is cooked, theyre already trouncing overwatch and they just released. When they have been out for a year or two the content and characters and balancing will have made this game violently outshine overwatch.

dub

If Overwatch were good it would be this game.

I like it better than OW.

This game is fun, just not for me. I can not, in good faith, recommend this game. The heroes all feel strong, but that results in having a super quick TTK, making it almost impossible, (at least for me), to react to what is hitting you. The characters that I played as mostly, Doctor Strange, Hulk, and Jeff, all felt nice at first, but with each game I played the feeling faded more and more. Whether it was just lack of damage, lack of movement, or lack of health, everyone I played kinda sucked. I'm aware this is probably just a skill issue on my part, but still, the game felt bad.
The maps were nice to look at, but the lack of being able to filter which maps I wanted kinda sucked, and with all the destructible environments everywhere, I just kept getting stuck. I personally enjoyed the Venom map the most, but every map was at least decent.
After about 20 games, I noticed that everyone just kept running the same characters, which made the game feel incredibly same-y, which also contributed to my lack of enjoyment.
I know this game can be good, but I think that right now it just feels awful to play

A BETTER OVERWATCH

Wont stop crashing every game

terrible optimization

if you enjoyed the original Overwatch days, youll enjoy this. Sure some characters could use some balancing but that will come with time. 
HOWEVER, this game is unfortunately less optimized than a rotten potato being used to GLADOS... CONSTANT FPS spikes (whenever Dr. Strange makes a portal results in ATLEAST a 40 fps drop if you lucky), lag spikes are common but not extreme (possible server overload due to amount of players), and its not uncommon for even more powerful GPU's to simply CRASH after three or so games... i suspect there is some kind of memory leak within the game as, from my experience, Game 1 will have little FPs issues. Game 2 will start getting problems, and Game 3 usually has EXTREME FPS issues leading to an eventual crash before Game 3 is done...
But if that and the requirement of a SSD isnt an issue, quite fun when you dont have OW2 players screaming in your ear that its not.

better than overwatch

jeff


why is it fun?

Marvel Rivals had a good launch and is totally dominating the hero team game scene right now. Each hero is super fun to play once you get the hang of them. Plus, the team-up abilities are crazy cool and add even more strategy to the game.

I've already sunk almost 100 hours into it, so you know I'm hooked. There are a couple of things that bug me, though. The battle pass costs 500 coins, which is cheaper than most games, but you only earn back 300 coins. It’d be nice if we could earn enough to get the next season’s pass without spending more real money.

The bigger issue, though, is the matchmaking. It’s almost never fair in quickplay and ranked matches up to higher ranks. You either get a super easy win or get totally wrecked. I'm not sure what they can do, but I hope they look into it.

On the upside, they did add a new mode for the holiday, which is awesome, and I hope they keep trying new things. They’re also doing a good job with handling cheaters and rule breakers, even though there are still plenty out there.

Overall, Marvel Rivals is a blast, with just a few things that need tweaking to make it even better.

chad overwatch

sure guy

After playing this game fine a week ago and no issues in any other game i get disconnected every single second and canjt even play a full game it is ridiculous to release a game like this and just constantly have this issue

This is a special game. You owe it to yourself to try it out. At first it may appear like another hero shooter but once you actually dedicate time to it and learn the heroes it's very rewarding. I also play Overwatch 2 they're both good. Overwatch caught a lot of heat but they're both good. I would say this one is a little better than Overwatch 2.

very fun

Jeff is too adorable. Oh and the game is great too.

This is a fun fast paced Third person shooter. Its a good time if you enjoy action and goal oriented missions. I would give it a shot!

Yes, it's good. But some people in this game were not. I hate it. I met a toxic duo. I hope they get banned.

its fun but could definetly use some more ability explanation and tune ups

its fun and fast paced

its just another hero shooter. better than overwatch... but that's not saying much

that stupid shark ate my whole team and killed himself. 10/10

its a game about rivaling


If you thought Monopoly was the ultimate friendship destroyer, welcome to your new nightmare! This game takes sibling rivalry and friendly competition to a whole new level. Prepare yourself for epic levels of frustration and heartbreak as your team stumbles through tasks with the coordination of a herd of cats. It’s so bad, you’ll be googling the Pop-Tarts instructions for some much-needed reassurance that directions do indeed exist for a reason. Your team’s blunders will have you rethinking every life choice that led you to this point. The game’s mechanics? Pure chaos. It’s like trying to herd squirrels on caffeine. Trust me, it’s not for the faint-hearted. You'll be wishing you were armed and dangerous as you bash your skull into a wall again and again and again...

better ow

Game runs like hot garbage on a 4070 and caused motion sickness...something even VR failed to do. Custom config file made it playable, but that's disabled now. (Latest drivers installed and whatnot)

So Marvel Rivals is now unplayable for me. GGWP back to Overwatch 2 that runs smooth as hell with no issues.

kinda cool

It's not as pretty or polished as overwatch, but it's dang fun and it's free so a solid yes out of 10

No role queue so I qq. 18/33 of the heroes are duelists. Dumb.

this game is so good i love the artstyle so much oh my god

jarvis solo ult this man

its Entertaining when i gets bored to the other game

It's incredible that this game is this polished and detailed right out of the gate like this.

AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!AGAIN!

IT"S GETTING STICKYYYYYY, then I preceded to get sticky all over Luna and one shot her, that's all you needa know peak game.

its good play it bc it's free

its pretty chill

Better than Overwatch in every aspect.

I remember playing OW when it came out and i was like "cool but itd be cooler with marvel heroes". thats what this is. great balancing, good modes, great mechanics, and just alotta fun

im hulking out

Good Game.
I truly did Marvel at these Rivals.

wewewewe

fun with friends

10-10

It's actually quite fun

This game is optimized worse then day 1 ARK

It's fun just don't solo queue.

unbalanced but fun. 

UPDATE: THIS GAME IS NO LONGER FUN. PEOPLE only play meta characters. and broken ults

jeff

Another EPIC victory. BIG WIN!

good

ITS SO MUCH FUN LOTS OF ACTION

pls make more dive dps im so happy omggg make it so they can one shot you without even pressing any buttonsssss <333

fun


peak


gay


Set everything to low and can't even get 15fps for a fight.

Clearly you don't own an air fryer.
Jarvis, solo ult the mammals on obj.
Friday, I want my mommy.

good

It was fun but skill based matchmaking has made it infuriating instead of being fun anymore. Skill based matchmaking ruins games.

Neat

cool game, pretty fun when I win, but it's kinda low fps (30 at most) even on the lowest settings for me

its fun'

like


Overwatch but more relatable since Marvel characters :D

AWESome

jeff

From someone who's been playing ow for the last 9 years, this game is def the real overwatch 2

My name Jeff

better than OW

Jeff the shark is a cancer

sticky

Hate this game, characters abilities are nerfed compared to the cannon and not beginer friendly matchmaking

Gyatttttt

It's fun.

It's not Overwatch

I fucking hate that dumb bitch with the squirrels and shit fuck her let my big wood ass and my shark be in peace you dumb whore.

if the devs keep up the support, could be the goat

It's like Overwatch without the toxic community and microtransactions.

Most fun I have had in a game in a while!

love it, best game i've ever played but i still require my jeff the land shark figurine

its coo

love

- love

fun game

Nice Game

game is fire fr

skibidi

PLEASEEE LEARN HOW TO PLAY FUCKING TANK, ITS NOT THAT FUCKING HARD

the game sucks, but i gotta keep this short to play another round

Great game that's gonna kill overwatch. 9/10

Jeff

good

this game ate (my brain, it feels like its rotting but its ok)

Feels rewarding and the games arent super long, only part that kind of sucks is the game can be fun solo but the second you play with 5 other friends youll never want to play solo again.

If you're a big fan of marvel then this might be for you. As an action game, this just doesn't offer anything new and it doesn't do what it does particularly impressively. Money grab.

Idont know


Titties

Some guy who spam SQUIRREL GURL at NNN is absolutely CINEMA

good game,nice design

This game is very fun,  some time you will be pissed of because of certain characters, but the game is awesome

eh. 2/10.

Some how my teammates turn invisible when there's a iron fist coming at me but ig its a good game 10/10

Good

Phase 4 was worth it.

Intense and fun.

:)

better than ow 2

so much fun. A polished, AAA title. Tons of hero's to choose from.

AGAIN ! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN! AGAIN!

Geinig klikkie om met je maten te spelen.

snoozefest

Spreaded with bunch of kids who don't even know to count to 10 , with R**ar**d AFK who can't be reported , F this Made in China game .

The fact that I paid full price for Overwatch at one point and this is offered for free? HECK YEAH

AGAIN!

love it so far.. only game i been really playing besides mobile.. but comp can get really toxic

cool

Genuinely has some of the worst balancing issues in any video game I've ever played. Ultimates are incredibly unbalanced and unfun to play with and against, characters seem to have no health relative to the damage that the other characters can output. Some need major nerfs and some need major buffs.

Don't even waste your brain space on this game. It's not worth it.

Great

Team outranked 10 matches in row :(

Very good iron fist is the best charater


Jeff The Land Shark

lol

so cool

jeff best healer imo

Good

overwatch if it was actually enjoyable

gut


Spider jizz


Like Overwatch at the beginning, everyone's imbalanced and no one knows how to play. FUN!

I cannot load the game, I've tried support just get responses like they haven't read my original message.  The time it says I've play is me trying to launch the game.

cancer

1000000/1 would recommend.
They know exactly what we want, caked up venom on top fr fr.
Venom's tongue, muscles and butt live rent free in all of our heads.

Lets talk about scarlet witch, for starters you don't even need to aim with her. As long as you are on the screen you are getting sucked off by her 24/7 and not in a good way. Her range is so long I can be in Antarctica and she could could still kill me. Also, she does more damage the more total health you have , it doesn't matter if your playing Groot or Luna Snow she will shred you in the same amount of time. And lastly her dumb tick freeze zone, the amount of times I've had my ultimate canceled because he has used this has caused me a unbearable amount of pain. I not even going to get started on anything else about her but in short she is only reason that people have quit this game.

i love throwing

.

The Overwatch we all needed, need I say more?

BANGA

i dont really like marvel, but this game is so addicting. feels like a fresh take on the round-based shooter. cant wait to see what they do next with it!

I hope you die overwatch, and marvel rivals is what buries you in the grave after curb stomping your teeth in for hours.

yes

fun

Good

great gameplay, enjoyable to play

fun

its fun

mhmmmmmm adiction

good


Utterly basic mechanics. Feels like a really crappy mobile game that had a headless chicken as a "dev team" ported to PC/console... Wouldn't be shocked if this entire game was made by AI. The amount of bots are way too high and no where do they tell you you're playing with/against bots when you don't queue for bot practice. 0.5/5 tbh

If you ever wanted the word 'again' to live rent free in your head, this is the game for you.

jeff is so me :3

One thing if u have freinds best game ever alot harder too play with out freinds

good in concept but released to early, servers are slow, cross play speed is even worse, and laggy game play making it almost unplayable. i play simalar game and have no problem. fix your shit



rhyiphihthy8ohoy yes

good

ARMED AND DANGEROUS

good game bad community

we needed an OW rival and we've got it!

spdiert mafn

for fuck sake

If you liked overwatch you will like this game.

this is a good game and i would recommend it but jeff the shark and an iron fist who flanks you every two seconds has to be the most annoying thing i have ever experienced. As well, I would love to know why i am constantly stuck at 99% when i am loading into a game and 7/10 times i will load in after the match has started. This means that I end up having to fill in for my teammates and it is overall horrible. Anyway have fun its a good game i swearrrrrrrrrrrr.

jeff

Great Game with Balanced Graphics!!!

great game

buss

PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURE CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS

Only fun for 2hrs max. It's free so guess it deserve the thumbs up.

Imagine if Marvel was owned by Disney

Boring, unbalanced, and an obvious race to include as many heroes ((and purchasable content)) as possible. Doesn't take long to see who the best heroes are and that mobility is king, but maybe it's my fault for not wanting to play the meta, or maybe I just don't like mobas. Probably more interesting as an f-u to other developers than it is as a game.

it's fun

ive played for 15 hours n already addicted, love this game and 100% recommend

I have never felt more alive.

idk aside from hawkeye needing to be nerfed its kind of just a fun lil hero shooter go pew pew

squirrel stampede

Tencent = win

This game is awesome. Def one of my fav games and I hope to continue to play it

bad on slow storage but soo fun when not stuck on 99% forever

sick

That one Psylocke so good :creeper:


overwatch but good

Unoptimised as HELL

Way better than overwatch

Good Game.

this game has very good ceilings

I am groot 👍

great

its fun and has a lot of content to farm so far


buy the pyslocke skin

GOOD 


advanced overwatch

great game

It's like if the creators of OverWatch 2 and Marvel Games decided to create one absolute gem and jewel of the Hero Shooter genre games. Highly recommend this to people who like hero shooters and Marvel characters.

goiod


mami

This game is way better than overwatch

well made characters ,maps,and skins, enviorment destruction  rea;lly fun game

nerf hawkeye

Destroy all uncs

Jogo muito bom e viciante

fun, learn to counter you will win.  Ult's are life.

Gud game make Magik the best character asap

Jarvis, solo ult the 0-7 dps

Makes me want to goon to Squirrel Girl.

Poor optimization

Jeff The Land Shark.
Nuff said.

they REALLY need to fix the crashing issue. I've been banned from queuing 4 times now from just the game crashing. Other than that, this game is actually quite sick, and almost all the characters rock.

brah the voice acting is ass

Enjoyable fresh hero shooter both for casuals and more competitive gamers.

Make sure you do not solo queue in comp it will not be a good time what you have to do is play with friends and still not have a good time but surrounded by friends

vedy goud

THE PSYLOCK SKIN IS MINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

hulks glorious green hulking bollocks

if you're playing with friends and they drop out if you leave to rejoin them the game will ban you if you dont stay in the match with the randoms

FUN

play groot to full box

America

more fun than I expected

good game

psylocke just psylocke

It's pretty good I think

 nice

JEFF

The Best "OvErWaTcH-LiKe" on the market!

Good game, I like the new takes in the hero shooter like 3rd person view, iron man and storm allowed to fly forever is great , and the Duo mechanic is super fun

Jeff Von keeps me up night

Comp is toxic af but its fun otherwise

this game is so good. i love when this cute shark kill my entire team and himself.

fun game

I love curbstomping jeff with hulk

quit good saw it on social media tried it out amazing graphics and design/art very cool 8.5/10 would recomend

Great Game!!

cool game , server balancing is a lil bit messed up tho

goated bro but i keep seeing venoms burly black cock ram me with a healer and its not fun when that happens
11/10 game tho!

cOOL game but payload is the dumbest shit in the world to play and IF you play it, may aswell have voted for kamala

I AM THE ONE WHO MOONS 
Also the game is great hope they won't fuck it up :)

gud

Better overwatch

it is good because uhhhhh because because um captain america

dubbed


The goods of the universe has blessed us the the most cheeked up version of the marvel universe we have ever seen. OHHH I gonna make a name for myself by being the world record holder for emptying my balls the fastest in the world. If the MCU had cake like this it would currently be tanking.

Great alternative to you know what.... but with MARVEL!

i like it

Moon Knight go brrrr

Game Slaps with friends, what more can I say.

Great game, a lot better than Overwatch. Love the Marvel IP idea and bringing in new heros is going to be amazing. I would join in now before it's too late! 

If you plan to play competitively, make sure you don't play solo try to find a team or some people to play with so it's easier for all of you to rank up. Enjoy!

Frame drops always tried everything to fix it and it jus wont work. Not a problem with my PC because I recently got new Parts and did an upgrade as well as pushing 200+ frames in other games. I've only played a real game like 4 times out of the 7 hours I've had this game.

It's good. You know what? Better than good - good enough.

jeff the goat

Better Than OW



bye bye ow2




fire game


Fun, JEFF

I have been waiting for this game since the first leaks dropped. Its amazing. If everyone is OP then no one is OP. Everyone is fun to play and I've been addicted since launch...send help

Point, Click, Chaos. Much good.

buff iron fist to have infinite health and nerf moon knight and squrirrle girl

The most amazing game I've played in a long time. The flow of the gameplay, the graphics, and the fun you have especially with your friends.

spooder man waw


good game tbh not gonna lie

Imagine playing this and being mentally stable

WAKANDA FOREVER

better than overwatch

forcing me to play a crap mode "convoy" i refuse and will not play this garbage mode, i will alt-f4 out of those matches everytime, you can ban me as many times as you want, i dont care, give me the option to chose which game modes i want to play, continue to try force me to play this trash mode and i will just go play a different game.

The game is incredibly fun. Even though I would work on balancing out the characters and fixing the ones that are completely useless, the mechanics are smooth, some of the characters' designs look clean, and a lot of the characters are genuinely fun to play with. This game gets an 9/10 for me : )

not really my kind of game, but this is fun and I play with friends which is really fun!  I thought for sure I would stink at this game, but I don't lol.

spider man doesnt kill

good

 This is a great game and could be really fun but the performance is terrible I'm running a 2070 supper era PC. Even with almost everything turned on low it still would lag like crazy.

a good overwatch

rlly gud

fun game, bad Von shark though

theres no reason for this game to need as much memory as it does fix your shitty game

Psylocke vengeance skin

this is definitely the overwatch killer


Desertion penalties for quick match is wild

shit as fuck team mates are retards and who the fuck adds ranked when you cant pre pick role its so bad just another overwatch clone

ight

Groot

It's free and dope but I am sure is not dope-free.

the game is cool but the qol is as and unbalanced and EVERY SINGLE game is rigged. The matchmaking is throwing the games and because of that every game is not even close

REEEEEEEEEEEEEE

its fire

yes

Funn

90's kid. - has small family - wife - 2 small kids

updates computer- enjoys game- fun game
laughs with friends- feels alive
game crashes alot because computer is too good.

Coming from Overwatch this is fun. All the abilities are creative and fun. Doesn't feel as smooth of an experience as Overwatch does if I'm being honest, but it is more fun than Overwatch 2 in its current state. I personally enjoy the trolling abilities like baby shark's launch off the cliff and Dr. Strange portaling people off the cliff even on the receiving side. I prefer the game to be more wild. Hopefully that doesn't change. As a previous Hanzo main, I'm having fun on Hawkeye. Blizzard nerfed Hanzo and I out of the game.

jef

i unlocked bankai and domain expansion after 10 hours

luna snow

good

Has a pretty solid roster of characters on release. A bit of jank on my comp (not the best specs) but it still runs overall well. I was pleasantly surprised at the balance on release, no character really feels like they're *too* powerful, it really is just more so who is playing them and how they're playing them that matters, as it should be. It's a really fun game if you're not trying to be a sweat and just enjoy a hero shooter with friends. Seems like the devs want to make a game that's fun first, unlike [insert hero shooter here].

It's got waifus, too

Great game to play casually or competetively.

Finally a good hero shooter that feels fun to play with a great range of characters that are all equally unbalanced, Just wished there were like 2 more maps for a bit more variety but other than that no real complaints (Except for the lack of Deadpool!)

a chinese guy filled with hatred fisted a shark
-10/10

marvel

goofy ah game

i like this game <3

fun

games pretty good, very overwatch-esque, players are all idiots but its a free to play, online, multiplayer game what do you realistically expect

Fire. Except the shark

Very fun, love the art style and of course its Marvel!!

+High skill ceiling
+Some excellent hero ability sets
+So much Marvel history
better than overwatch

Fun game that needs more game types, but it's a solid hang-with-friends Overwatch clone. Loving the stage and character design so far and hope to see it grow over the years.

s

better than overwatch and actually enjoyable although some nerfs to characters could be in order.

Peak

Better Overwatch


mcuh enjoy

amazing game best game for 2025 such a great game everything done perfectly fuck overwatch compared to rivals

Fun game when it works, the memory leak issue is real. Only get to play 1-2 games before it crashes

This game slaps.

It is a fun game to play



yes king

IT'S ADDICTING BUT IT'S THE WORST GAME THIS YEAR!

I hate this game

Overwatch but not gay

THE BEST GAME WOULD NU

Great

free

Goated game

5.5/10
Needs serious work imo.

Game just looks and feels like a mobile game.
Still fun tho.

Best we can get for a new comp game until some company steps up and makes something good.

Went in with 0 expectations, and now it seems I've discovered... addiction... damn it...

git wsm

Si

Game doesn't have role based competitive play. This makes for an incredibly frustrating experience playing the game competitively. I was able to reach D3 and then uninstalled the game right after as a result of having to fill 8/10 games because people simply auto lock and refuse to play to meta win (If you want to do that in normals that's fine, but ranked is completely different). Having role based queueing would solve this issue. For those that like competitive play, this game is not for you until they add that.

oy esd hppf o ;pbr oy

Luna do da dance

GOOD GAME

Joining games is very fast. Gameplay is fun and challenging at the same time. If you like games similar to Overwatch you'll enjoy this game.

Jarvis, see that family of 4?
MAXIMUM PULSE

I can play this all day

overwatch knockoff... boring af and quite unbalanced. a lot of bots in pvp games too

I love overwatch

love it

wish it had role queue, which is my only complaint

Jeff the Land Shark is the greatest character in all of fiction.

good game

Supports getting more kills then there DPS like if your a support main

negatively affects my mental health

EVERYTHING

Its a fun game

its good


If you're coming from Overwatch, the movement feels awful.

After a couple crashes that the Rivals client informed me were "GPU crashes", I followed their prompts to the letter to resolve it, which it did not. Three crashes in a couple hours played and the game is basically unplayable for me. 2070Super and a 3600X so I'm not on bad hardware.

Some of the hero ultimate abilities are too strong which spells instant death which also makes the game feel gimmicky with lack of counter play.
Maybe the game has a really steep learning curve with the amount of abilities each hero has, but it's fairly demotivating to play at times.

Quick match making, minimal bugs, fun gameplay, true to lore, worked on release. Simple as that.

6v6 = Better game

great game 10/10

its just great fun tbh

Jeff my beloved

Good

seruu!!

Amazing game that has me hooked. The design team has absolutely cooked a well, every hero looks amazing and the skins are incredible.

it awesome

shit is dope asf!

great game, heroes are fun, matches are fast

jeff+ groot combo goated

jeff

Good Game better than Overwatch

jeff

Yes I'd recommend it, one caveat is my game keeps crashing out of nowhere.

better than overwatch,

luna snow can get it


best hero shooter

JEFF

I played this for 9 hours straigh i regret my choices. Is the game good not really, is it fun yes?
Felt some rubber band or hitboxes issue but other than that good

LEEEEGEEEEEEENNNDARYYY

Glad Iron man died in that fking movie

w

better overwatch

"da da daa daaa daaa daaaa" - Jeff

I thought it would be terrible because overwatch is the worst game i have EVER played in my life but marvel rivals is actually pretty fun and i really like Jeff the shark.

Psylocke and venom makes me horny. Would recommend to anyone.

Downloaded game but haven't been able to get it to work. I followed all of the FAQs and attempted to work with customer support to resolve the issue but they are are not paying attention to the information that I am sending them. They just keep asking me for things I can't give them because I can't get to that point in the game. 

For the terrible support, I cannot recommend this game.

best mp game ever

awesome game

I just drank a 2 liter of cherry coke

heavy game but looks nice and runs fine on medium/low visual settings for me, characters are cool and kits work well with their background whilst also being mostly fair and balanced, probably my favorite team based shooter game

fun when you get to play but gets kicked randomly i have a decent computer and get kicked randomly when playing with good ping. also it takes forever to load in needs to be optimized for pc.

One of the best online games I've played! Marvel really nailed it! So excited to see where it goes! I do wish people would quit only locking DPS but aside from that it's solid. Maybe make an optional Role Que.

runs like absolute dog sht

vcfc drcddcrfvtgbyhnjm

good but omfg the optimization is absolute dookie, especially after the most recent update

yes

Gud gaem

jeff is literally the most adorable thing in the history of games <3

it just overwatch but choppy af 
still enjoy the game tho

Sh*t game full of cheaters, keep crashing every other match, menu and end game animations are taking forever which is crazy annoying, do yourself a favor and dodge this game

Free Hela skin without underwear. 12\10

Great game, amazing co-op experience.

wih arms wide open

.

Got eaten by shark dog, then fisted by iron fist

I love this game i just wish healers would just heal and not focus on damage thats all thanks

10/10 game

Jeff

great game


Game is super fun however, 

the unbalanced heros, unbalanced ults, unbalanced team up perks, along with AOE circles being misaligned with its affects, can and does make you run into game breaking moments and match ups making the experience pretty miserable. 

I have been playing everyday since launch and the past 3/4 days have truly turned from fun into miserable games with a few wins.   

now that players have learned whats broken you run into these broken and unbalanced match ups over and over again, and being that lowwer level ranked ques can not hero ban picks, you are left with nothing but unbalanced unfun gameplay.  

until they address these balance issues i am taking a break from this the game. 

I have played OW since OW1 beta, and this game was so needed and so fun,  until it wassnt, and now it isnt.  

fix it.

Plays very similar to Overwatch, except it is a very fun game

baddies

i cant even play it


Good game, easy to get into, great hero shooter. If you liked Overwatch 1/2 you should enjoy this game even more. They're very similar except this game is decent and not run by a terrible company and has good UI, controls, and cheat detection.



can never get into a match, $1200 pc, internet speed tests reads well, turn my setting to the lowest setting and yet always freezes at 99% of match loading.  By the time I load in the game hits you with a deserter/afk penalty, you get to play maybe a minute of game play and boom match over.  We shouldnt need a $2000 rig to play  a free game. 


good fun

fun game

I LOVE CURB STOMPING THE SHARK

Wow, a 6v6 team hero fighting game with a wide range of characters and abilities, and its BALANCED???

I do not like this game. Do not be fooled by the number of hours played, my girlfriend likes the game, enough said.

the Web-head and my Symbiote Slime are so much fun to play. I don't care how many times I get eaten by Jeff or beaten my brakes off by Iron fist. Stalking people by sticking to the ceiling to only dive bomb and basically kill any squishy will never get old.

I've got penalized because my game crashed twice. Great!

Very good game. Needs slight adjustments to the game such as character buff/nerfing, but overall a good game.

W game

Game 1: Did well, won game
Game 2: Joined a Game in progress, defeated, kicked out
Game 3 - 4 / 5: All Defeats because my character was rubberbanding (multiple jump, getting pulled back to the same spot, jumped to a random spot) excessively to the point of unplayablity.

Settings: Ultra Performance with the lowest settings possible
Character played: Spiderman

If they fix the rubberbanding I would probably try it again however I can not recommend at this time

overwatch but good

No wait time for matches

This game would be fine if it didn't crash no matter what settings I changed to. For context, my PC is a Ryzen 9 RTX 4080 Super with 64GB RAM and I am CRASHING WITHOUT RUNNING ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE GAME AND A SINGULAR MUSIC APP.

The Music app doesn't use up even 1 or 2% of my CPU or GPU

gud

Great variety and gameplay.

My team pick Groot and stays still in the spawn. When I tell him to move, he keep saying "I'm groot I'm groot"
Nice
Its a truly video game that ever existed.

Jeff ate my cat.
10/10 stars

ehh


is ok, just ow1 but marvel lol

Horrid matchmaking!

overwatch but fun :)

I AM IRONMAN, and yes... you Love me 3000

idc it needs a role queue and global health regen and the fps is so trash it's unbelievable, it's so bad and the graphics aren't even that good nor do they matter too much for a competitive game like this and balance the heros and that's it when they fix these i'll give it a thumbs up good luck

Amazing game! So many strategies and very creative fun play styles!

Overwatch 2 but better, it's just the truth don't get mad about it.

I do not recommend this game.

Seems like a decent game but the optimization is nonexistent, which makes for a miserable experience when combined with the insane amount of screen clutter going on at any given time. Would not recommend unless a performance patch drops and even then it'd have to be one hell of an upgrade.

Jarvis: sexually assault every iron fist player

better overwatch still needs balancing

w

I don't know how the game is really because steam crashes on the loading screen and then the game crashes...

f

   %100 recommend if your looking for a free strategy online PVP super hero game to play with friends or family!!!

     
Marvel Rivals is like fortnite but its not the same map everytime for 3 months + less people and more enjoyable and you respawn so you can try again other then waiting another min to get to another server. My favorite part is getting to pick hero's as there is over 30 for free to pick from, and each one you have to use your strategy mind of yours to fight other players, such good fun %100 recommend, try it for yourself it's free + really good fun if your into Marvel

It dookie but addicting

A hero shooter with Marvel Heroes, what else do you need to know

Its super fun

:]

jeff the land shark is peak character design 


neato its nice

Great game. The Overwatch 2 that we should have got

game of the year

Games really good, for fans of things like Overwatch this game is a real treat.

"What are we, some sort of Marvel Rivals?"

Please add professor x and his signature move holo (you know what i want to type here) beam

Addicting

Fun at first, but very unbalanced heros, leaves you always with feeling of unfairness.

announce gambito

captain america bad

gsf

it is fun :)

Never thought I would get chased down by a pack of squirrels in a game. 10/10

better ovewatch

good game

I always wanted to try Overwatch, but never got around to it. Found this right at its start, and it looks like it's going great.

good gem


Fun  until they remove the ability to mod.

На пару часиков сойдет

Fun game. Needs a few balances. Better than Overwatch 2.

Good game, better than any other in the genre right now.

Fun, variety of heroes and even enjoyable in ranked

Very fun. 4.6 stars out of 5. The only reason for this is because they do not have my favorite marvel hero in game. Other than that though, very fun and addicting, with great multiplayer.

Best shooter to come out in years! So much fun

Bad Balance , esp in ranked. Only able to ban at Diamond. seasonal buffs for already strong characters. and Bot matches. fun at first but thats it

Squirrel Girl THICCC

Also the game is solid.

if you want to have an unplayable infuriating time rubber banding and other people zipping around the map and getting hit around corners then this game is for you

games so ass you have to play it its a crazy shit game that everyone has to try before they die.

its a nice game when you get the hang of most things. some characters might feel very overpowered but that's because most characters are very good in their own way

Second round i played was shot and killed threw a wall. This is the reason i no longer play pvp shooters. the only true way to get rid of this is to bring back active admins. To simply rely on software to do our job is stupid . Bring back active admins and white listed, private, dedicated servers.  i know this is NOT the game in question but this is one of many videos that highlights the bigger problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LfGcDB7Ek&ab_channel=g0at

yummers!!!!

This game is very, very bad. I can't play it without crashing and I play a lot of games that require more than this. I wish they would a least say this is a beta version or something because the game is clearly unfinished.

the overstimulated overwatch version

Easy to comprehend if you're coming from another fps, especially Valorant or Overwatch

overwatch if it was good
sqirl girel\
nerf jeff

Overwatch, but like a little less polished and Marvel.

I love thus game pls dont die I dont want to go back to overwtach pls.

This game is absolute dog shit when it comes to a fun game. Sure it has great graphics, great gameplay, but my god the match making is by far the worst I've seen in games. OW actually has decent match making, this game is absolute dog shit at attempting to make it a fun game. I swear their alogrithim tries to fincd the most boring one-sided team to win.

0/10 do noit play

This game fucks hard. Harder than the Honda Odyssey

this game is terrible

Just awesome, had a lot of fun during evening/night game session.

It's Spidertime

e

They try to be overwatch, except fun. Could've done it, too, if they had any idea how to balance the game.

Shame. Another one for the bin 🤷

I have been mainly playing solo competitive and have been having a blast! Of course there are some heros that feel overtuned, but the state of game is still fluid and fun to play.

play this or league either way it's gonna ruin your life

Very fun game. Its hard to get bored with it!

Great game, but optimization is for this game is garbage and sht. I can run bo6 on a potato better than this like jesus. Otherwise only issue.

Excellent fun free-to-play hero shooter.
100% recommend.



mid

W game

overwatch 2 if it was good

Better than OW2

good

This game is like smoking newports, it additicting and fun, this is an exellent game to play with the family, but if you end up facing a skilled iron fist main, you end up wanting to rip your skin off. Great game! This game is almost perfect, but if they add MRWHOSTHEBOSS to the game it would take it to a whole new level, his abiltys would be throwing speakers and charging you up with a 3 in 1 wirlesss fast charger.

THIS GAME IS SO FUN


jeff the shark is perfectly balanced

people are selfish in competitive not wanting to make the team right 2 tank 2 dps or 2 healers best to have that a lot of people love to play what they like to play more than what is needed or what they are better at :C

Broken Characters and bxllshit r3tarded axs players that dont know wtf they are doing
same thing as ow2
Worst bxllshit " strategy " game ever.

great game, Overwatch Killer

12 year old kids are playing this, and can't play in a normal game mode.

so hard to play this game with one hand but once you master it, it's a really fun game

its fun!

great game

I am the #1 Squirrel Girl

fun fun fun

Very good, however the requirements are quite high, so games are often laggy. If you have a very strong computer, I would reccomend.

ow2

overall fun

good game. more fun than the other game we want to hate.

Imagine Overwatch, but Spiderman can kick you in the jaw.

gg

better than overwatch

I like everything

I might be addicted. Its not a better  game than overwatch but its 10x more fun.

good

sigma fuun game eys


The only bad thing about this game are the crashes that are somewhat frequent. 
(Also the Dr Strange portal fries the FPS, but I guess thats a "just get a better PC" issue)

Other than that it is the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in quite a while.

Characters are all unique and easy to pick up, and the abundance of melee-styled characters is a nice contrast to other hero-shooter games.

It's cool. Easy to jump into. Doesn't suck whale balls like OW.

overwatch but thick


better than overwatch

Not going to lie. I love this game. A lot of people compare this game to Overwatch, and i'll say that it is very similar....... to OG Overwatch. You know back when that game was actually fun. There are unique differences of course. Ones that I've grown to love (ex: 3rd Person, team combo abilities, and destructible environment). I love that most of the heroes feel strong. Their abilities are cool, lore accurate, and feel powerful. I've seen SOOOO many heroes be able to carry teams. You'll see people on line talking about nerfing almost every hero. This game gets an easy thumbs up for me. If you like Hero Shooters, this is THE ONE.

<3

My OW2 replacement is here! And its so fun! :D

if you want to never see the light of day again play this game

Unoptomized garbage,  ran at 5fps and i have a good pc

luna snow fat mod

peak gaming

when are they adding nightcrawler.

very cool game

.

great game just don't be bad

i am prince vegeta. hawk tuah. spit on that thing

Very fun hero shooter

Its like a breath of fresh air.

it good

mahvel ryevahls


It deserves higher than an 80% approval rating, especially after the garbage with Overwatch 2. It's fun, complete day 1, with such a wide variety of characters that you're bound to find someone you like from the Marvel universe that matches your style, and they went just crazy enough with their character designs that pretty much everyone is going to feel powerful if you don't suck ass at the game. Plus, it's free. There's really no excuse.

Way better then most hero shooters and not buggy, honestly one of the best hero shooters on steam.

FIX YA GAME YA TWAAAT WAFFLES. LITERALLY DIDNT GET TO PLAY EVEN ONE GAME. FIRST TWO I TRIED GOT LOAD LOCKED AT 99% -100/10 TRASH GAME

iron fist beat the shit out of me and i broke my monitor, 10/10

ITS SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!

Its everything Overwatch is not; this game is fun and enjoyable with a fairly wide range of characters.

all the girls are girling girling

Perfect

Great game focused on fun first, but it has horrible performance issues. I have a good PC and I get constant stutters and freezes.

Lots of fun

Jeff The Land Shark




It's like Overwatch! But playing anything other than DPS is actually impactful!

luna snow has single-handedly been my gateway into k-pop

I recommend it!


FUN SO FAR ALLOT OF COOL STUFF GOING ON GOOD TEAMPLAY GAME SIMILAR TO OVERWATCH

Runs like ass ngl

Hero shooters aren't my genre actually, but I still gave the game a chance after hearing all the hype aorund it. I'm playing on a casual level for 10 hours now, and I must say that I enjoy it more than I expected.
Easy to get into and have some fun and successful moments.
Runs perfectly smooth.
Has beautiful art design without DEI-nonsense.

I can't comment on balancing and gameplay on a competitive level, as I only play (and ever want to play) it just for fun - and for that, it works awesome.

Pretty good

awd

better than overwatch

Let me purchase in game currency plz

I shoot things and they die. good game

the better overwatch

Imagine Overwatch, but actually fun, non-toxic, no bugs and actual Marvel characters.
Go for ittttt

fun to play, f2p friendly

very fun game but is completely unplayable from all the crashes, get the game now and wait for the crashes to be fixed then start playing

tons of fun, early overwatch vibes

great.

love the game

shahkar


Feels like how Overwatch started back in 2014, shame there isn't a first person view option

good good

Literally just a copy of Overwatch 2, the roster is highly unbalanced, for example: Bruce Bnnaer(Hulk) with his ult has 3 lives, hawkeye can hit you, without actually even hitting you at all with his ult, also everyone who plays him just left click spams and somehow manage to fully charge their shot within 0.2 seconds.
Health overall for all characters is basically just 50 hp, because everything either one or two shots you, hitboxes are also very janky and don´t even match the actual characters themselves, overall one of the worst games I´ve played.
Even the real overwatch is way better than this cheap crap.

yessir i love thicc squirrel girl mod!

Buff cap

just as shit as overwatch but hey marvel skin

it's like Overwatch if it was still fun.

awesome

Lots of fun.

Goated

so many cheaters, until they update the anticheat, the ranked game mode wont be touched by me. I face at least 1 cheater per ranked game.

I CAN STOP AT ANYTIME I SWEAR

fun

Super fun and refreshing, theres so many characters to choose from its hard to get bored.

not marvel very china

TO FUN

Fun, can't go wrong with it being free.

funny

fuck scarlet witch

black widow nice ass

The style is great
Picks for characters are great
Characters feel fun and different from each other, but familiar if you have played other games like OW or Paladins
great if you are good at it

i am not good at it
:T

I dont really know what to do anymore... but atleast i have this game!!!!

good game


Amazing game absolutly love it!!!

like it


i fw it

Very cool game

mo7n

Easily one of if not the best game(s) released in years. Good shit NetEase

its a pretty ok game but my gosh nuking a whole team by swallowing them with a tiny adorable shark and jumping face first off the map, while Creed slowly starts playing in your head... best feeling! Even better when the 11 year old on the enemy team playing on their Xbox starts throwing slurs your way...

im never playing any other game

I am a long time Overwatch player. OW2 has been a real sad place lately. They are starting to experiment with 6v6 again, but at this point, my love for that game has already left.

In comes Marvel Rivals. It's appealing for the obvious reasons: i'm a fan of the heroes, the art style is cool, gameplay is fun. But what I love about this game, and what I think makes it stand out from other hero shooters, is in the philosophy I am seeing so far in terms of team composition, hero balance, and overall gameplay feel. 

I get the sense that the developers of this game are more concerned with the "hero fantasy" and "rule of cool" rather than trying to formulate a perfectly competitively balanced hero roster like Overwatch 2 has been trying to achieve. I love that people can't yet agree on whether Hulk is trash or busted, same with Scarlet Witch, or Namor, or Iron Man, or Wolverine, etc. Obviously we are still VERY early in the game's life, but from what I can see, you can pop off with just about anyone. And a big part of what enables certain characters to pop off lies in my favorite thing about Marvel Rivals: the team-ups.

Currently, there aren't very many team-ups, and they vary quite a bit in terms of how impactful they actually are. Rocket Raccoon's teamup with Bucky and Punisher, for example, is MUCH more powerful than how Rocket or Jeff can ride Groot's shoulders, which is way more cool/cute than it is actually functional or competitively viable. But, the prospect of what these team-ups can mean for the future of the game... It elevates the possibilities to a whole other level. People have been arguing about this game needing a role lock system, but down the line, if there are a bunch of team-ups that can make an otherwise funky composition work, then that is so much more exciting than "we both have 2-2-2 every game because it's easier to balance". Again, the rule of cool takes precedent here, and I LOVE that. It is so much more fun and makes me really exciting for the possibilities in future team-ups... like what if they introduced bigger team-ups for having 4+ Avengers with bonuses for different roles, or all members of the Fantastic 4 get some big combo, same with X-men, etc. The possibilities are endless and that's super exciting.

Overall, I'm having a VERY good time with this game. I would consider myself a casually competitive gamer... I don't need to grind ranked and have the highest number to have fun, but I definitely have the most fun learning the mechanics, improving on a variety of heroes/roles, and popping TF off. This game fits my preferred experience perfectly. I definitely recommend trying it out and giving it a couple hours to see if you enjoy how it flows.

BRTTTTTTT

This third-person shooter delivers a perfect mix of fast-paced action, strategic gameplay, and a roster of iconic characters that Marvel fans will love. The inclusion of fun and quirky additions like Jeff the Shark adds a layer of humor and charm that sets the game apart.

Compared to Overwatch 2, "Marvel Rivals" feels more engaging and innovative. The character designs are not only visually stunning but also distinct in their playstyles, making every match feel unique and exciting. Whether you’re zipping through the map as a high-flying hero or causing chaos as a heavy-hitting brawler, there's something for everyone.

One of the standout features of *Marvel Rivals* is its impressive environmental destructibility. It strikes a perfect balance—not overwhelming the gameplay but adding just enough to keep every match dynamic and immersive. Buildings crumble, cover gets shredded, and debris realistically reacts to the chaos unfolding around you. The destruction feels purposeful and polished, enhancing the strategic depth without becoming a gimmick. It’s a testament to the developers’ attention to detail and commitment to delivering a high-quality experience.

My gameplay favorites are Moon Knight, Hawkeye, Luna Snow, and Psylocke. Each of them brings something unique and making every match feel fresh and exciting

overwatch if none of the characters were fun and the guns felt awful to use and everyone instalocked a dps and refused to switch

you want to play the game on a competitive level  ? well get ready to be immersed in a lovely experience from your random teammates instalocking dps to the dog water inbreds u get paired with. if u plan on grinding ranked this is not the game for u if u wanna play and have fun with friends go ahead

The game is fun, but most of the time, I don't load in until after the round has already started. They need to actually make the game playable, regardless of where it is installed

great exprince love spider man just a great game some times i rage but its becasue  die


if you have a good system and good internet. UR Good. if you don't have any of them. the game will make you regret. But after All it's a good game and i recommend it.

ccol


It's a great start to what looks like might be one of the best multiplayer game to come out in 2024. I would recommend this to someone looking for a better Overwatch style game play.

Game is practically unplayable as a solo player without role queue. You can be the hottest fragging strategist  and you will still lose if your teammates are a bunch of mouth breathers that only pick dps roles. Hurr durr muh damage.

.

all the girls are girling

Great game realy fun, China has become a top Developer in the last few years

better than OW

Great game, with fun list of characters. Can't wait for Ultron and Green Goblin to join. only negative is that game needs to get bit more optimized.

what overwatch wishes it was

Its good, tho EVERYTHING feels severely overpowered, which can absolutely destroy the fun you want to have. 

Its forgiven because the game is fresh. 

tbh, this is my only complaint.

fun

this game fucking sucks go into comp your team always sucks ass game recamended

im in the house like carpet

Very good game, however, currently does not support streaming through steams remote play feature. Also, there are performance issues that need to be addressed. Lots of players want to play it but cannot due to hardware

Better than Overwatch

cool game

Better less balanced (more fun) overwatch.

Its JEFF!

sick game

good

It's STRANGE how good this game is. Namor.

psylocke op

nerf iron fist

The lag makes the game absolutely unplayable. Specs: 2080 super i7-9700k. The game is run at the literal lowest settings humanely possible and I crank out an average 40 - 60 fps. Absolutely embarrassing optimization it's like it was a complete oversight by the dev team.

Goated


Fun and varied hero choices

its a great fast pace game that peaks my interest with the amazing art style and the characters from all my favorite movies and shows fighting each other. i also find the voice lines really good and shows the personality of all the characters perfectly.

I love luna snow


Fun game. No DEI. Quick play is very unbalanced though. Half my games are just one team shitting on the other.

its good

Nah Im good, plus my pc crashed.

The Ultimate Successor to Overwatch 1.

hela my goat

RIP King Von

good

stokac zmaj is #rank player in game <33333

fix the crashing its really annoying and you especially shouldn't punish people for it (especially if it crashes the WHOLE PC like it does mine)

Very fun

Good game

Cool game, alright community

I'll change my review when they fix the once an hour crashing on nvidia cards. It's expected at this point, look over reddit and rivals forums and you'll find it loves to crash roughly once an hour almost to the dot.

EEEEEEEEE

i like the luna snow mod

fuck the shark bro

One can hope that this game wipes overwatch off the face of the earth.

It's a fun game, but I feel like it's gonna get the "Overwatch treatment". I feel like this game is quickly gonna turn super toxic, and then just filled to the brim with micro transactions

ITS GOOD GAME BUTTT  GP GAME AND SOME HEROS ITS NOT OPTIMIZED BUT THEY CAN FIX this  i think

hero for dog

w

Disgusting game, the "fun" is there only when you queue as 4+ people. Balance team is just sleeping on the support and tank roles. Difference between Luna Snow that has Rocket Racoon ult with 40% dps amp but at the same time fully healing your team while being immune to any cc for 12 seconds is a bit crazy. Dps output of supports like mantis and luna is unhealthy for the game or tanks like penny and strange that can 1v5 while your dps are drooling all over the keyboard. On top of that the game has no role queue so ur just forced to insta lose the game when u have 1 support or 5 dps.

In other words if u want to rank up pick luna and mantis for support role / penny, strange, magneto to have 90% winrate till diamond.

yes i believe so

RIP OW

keeps crashing

it's a hero shooter with characters you know and love, major balance issues because some heroes are obviously way better than others but there's enough broken shit that nothing is broken. So if you like being occasionally frustrated at shit that made no sense, until you understand it and it makes sense, which has a curve that I've yet to get over, then yeah this is a good game for you. Otherwise, steer clear.

sex

The game is fun , but crash all the time and that ruin the experience. Unplayable.

ITS SO GOOD BEACUSE IT IS FDVNJDFVSEAHDBHUIBGHIUYDCSBG8YDEGY7CFDVSGT7VDFSGEGY7T8VRFEHY79HY79B8FERSHU8BY7FG9RS

Holographic please!

good game jeff is fire

It's pretty cool

Good

welcome in overwatch killer

Potential Overwatch killer

Even on the lowest settings this game runs like garbage and is barely playable, had to switch to console.

fire

better than overwatch.

yes

A game that has:
- 30+ characters at launch.
- FREE!!
- Non-FOMO Battlepass system - The BP never expires!!
- Being able to convert in-game currencies 1:1
- Easy to pick up and play.
- Also hard to master.
- Enough to keep the casual happy and also give the grinder things to grind for.

plenty of phat a$$ for free, would reccomend.

OG overwatch with marvel skin and unique spells/skillsets. I just wish it had a better progress system or at least some kind of loot box system to reward grinding out matches.

the shark is funny

Fun F2p fps shooter, watch overwatch wanted to be basically. PCgamerChannel on youtube for gameplay footage. Thank yoU!

Absolutely horrible performance, unplayable.

Better than Overwatch

this game is nigga

Like Overwatch, but fun

Pretty much exactly like Overwatch, but with Marvel characters in Third Person. I don't think it's better than Overwatch like most people say it is, but still a good game! Only thing that I hope they update is having a role queue with at least 2 heals, 2 dps, and 1 tank cause right now everyone wants to dps and while I don't mind playing heals, I would also like to switch it up and tank/dps as well. Overall this game is pretty fun, if you like Overwatch and Marvel you'll enjoy it. All I have left to say is Jeff the Shark, absolutely freaking adorable and will take over your soul with his cuteness!

No good game.

They use bots in Quick Match. As in the supposed PvP mode. It really sucks the fun out of playing.

Cool game better than overwatch

fix the damn crashes

Better than ow2 and ive played overwatch in the past, its fun the gameplay is good and overall game is fantastic if they continue like this the game will have more sucess than already has

ill recommend it when it stops crashing. debug mode doesnt even work

Only thing to dislike is the noobs who get on ranked to drag others down and the fact you cannot play ranked based on role and you can have 6 dps on the team, which again is less skill based wins.

Very addicting.. I love the comic accurate skins

my main is bruce

game good

Ok for a free to play game. They'll probably introduce more characters later. As for NOW too many game crashes and often launcher faliure. When the game works its fine. Not for me though might check this out after a month or 2

it good

Overwatch who?

good shit

This game is real fun. Feels a bit chaotic but in a good way. Roster is huge for a starting roster and character choice is good. The visuals are insane and the gameplay feels like Paladins but more polished (I'm not gonna make an OW comparison). Monetization is fair imo especially cuz you can get the currency for free which isn't that common nowadays. 
Good game

This is Overwatch but if it had a competent team making it again

me like

play with 5 friends and this game is great. If you solo play you need to play  Tank/support

Should be called Great Value Overwatch

It's like when you go to Walmart and there's the Great Value brand. That's what this is, it's Overwatch, but with a Marvel skin. Is it better, mostly, but it's still a shameless cash grab with overpriced skins and a pathetic battle pass. The balance is off, the abilities aren't there for some character (Magneto is nothing what he should be) and some characters are just straight up busted/OP. Sadly, like all "live service" games, we are the beta testers and there's a lot to test.

I wish Steam could give us refunds for battle passes. This one is one of the worst I have ever seen. All skins no one will give a F about. It's also super short compared to Fortnite or any other live service game. Has ZERO skins anyone actually wants (MCU, etc). Total trash tier skins.

Overall It has promise for sure and is clearly better than OW2, so I hope to change this to a recommended in the near future. If like me, you are willing to put up with the jank and want to scratch that OW itch, this is really the "best" there is for now.

Really in-depth and easy to learn.

its ok i guess .

Finally a good game to spend my hard earned pennies on.

gr8 fun m8s

yeah

It would be really cool if they added more characters like a healing class, or maybe cut down on the amount of duelists, or maybe more support characters so you don't have to wait to be healed, if ever

 Yeah its alright. nuttin special

20x better OVERWATCH

Hell yeah

Did u like overwatch one when it frist came out? Good! Youll like this more AND its free so even better.

This game is a great time machine.

For the first time pop-culture is right. This game is awsome.
Love Black Widow btw.

god I love digital artists, great work <3

gg

add guns

..

dogshit ass game


GG

It's fun. Is it the most fun? No. Is it still a solid game with some really interesting abilities and fighting mechanics? Yes. Will it kill Overwatch? We shall see.

good.

thighlocke

dope af

Overwatch but better. The game has very good settings. you can optomize and change everything easily. only complain is that it has some bugs but game is 2 weeks old so expected. 9/10

fun and free

yer

horrible fps optimization, but if u can aim good then games fun

YUP

Game is fine. But if you lose a few games in Quick Play you play against bots... I don't play PvP games to play against bots...

bad

k

overwatch 2 without the gay and bullshit great game

goated

i am groot

its a realy fun game, good abilty and maps.. but the only problem its no role queue. and that is a realy big problem on mid rank. many player only want to play dps. i get derank because of that. 1 healer or 1 tank. 75% of my games always like that

Jeff.

Jeff

ITS SUPER FUN

Si

Good game but you need team work and a good healer



good

very fun! Scratches the itch that Overwatch cant anymore. Vast variety of characters to choose from and a lack of ''META'' makes this for a fun gaming experience.

peak

Jeff :)

that fuckin fish that i hate

Boring, just as bad as overwatch.

Very unbalanced and full of selfish people who won't play support. I love it.

get it

i have 30+ minutes of "play time" all of which was just stuck on a black screen. i have tried everything to fix it but nothing works.

Armed And Dangerous....

good game


This new DLC for Overwatch 2 is great!

dropping out of school and quitting my job to focus on marvel rivals wish me luck guys

Magik is life

Very fun and stylish free to play.

Way better than overwatch

jeff

Nobody will read my review so I will eat 1 Tablespoon of Spicy Ketchup for every like this gets.

the best game I have ever played

yAY FUN PSYLOCKE SKIN AND JEFF

اح

Lower the prices for skins. I ain't paying $25 for one skin for one character. Otherwise, great game.

It's like being back in 2016 and launching Overwatch for the first time! Amazing game!

hehe psylocke and luna snow :D

Good quality

wakanda forever

Great game needs some balancing but what doesn't  these days. is a great game for gamers of any age.

i hope jeff goes to hell

Wow, Nice !

best player most time played

I give the game an 8 out of 10, few bugs but they are pretty big, competitive right now is pretty bad as nobody works as a team, have a lot of leavers and bots but the game IS fun.

Maps are amazing, heroes are amazing

vibes

fiya

dogshit
how can anyone enjoy this

Very fun game

playing thor is like cocaine directly into your brain

gave me a cancerous mole on my knob

It's fun even if you don't play shooters at all!

amazing way better than overwatch 2

Spiderman.

Another streamer slop game that will be dead in 3 months.  Unbalanced mess of a game that only benefits from the Marvel IP.

good

Honestly the most fun I've had gaming in many years ngl

Im loading in half the game...

I hate Iron Man can go suck my fat willy and iron fist Fucking hate tem

aids but kinda fun

crashes constantly


Honestly I'm just down bad for Magik and Luna Snow 🤷

just goated no need to explain

keeps on crashing

im hooked! the teamwork abilities are great, gameplay is very synergetic. having a blast with namor particularly!

Fun, even if you're bad. Non-toxic. And neat to play as you're favorite Marvel chars.  I was especially happy to see Magik there. She is my favorite in the Marvelverse.

If you aren't already playing, what is wrong with you?

If you value your privacy, you can either not or go fck yourself.

Better than OverWatch

-10/10

Good game. I like the playstyle more than Overwatch, especially the mobility, team-up options, and environmental destruction. The art-style is great, the characters look good, and the matchmaking is instant.

Marbel Rival

So far a fun game, quick matches and would be great to have a bit more tutorials to breakdown the different combos to go for, for each hero.


Fun with Marvel, n'uff said.

It's good to finally give Overwatch some competition. The blizzard devs have been running OW like chickens with their heads cut off, and this might give them some incentive to pull their shit together. I was expecting since it was a free to play superhero game it would be wonky, but the characters are actually designed really well with kits that are fluid, make sense for the characters, and feel amazing. The hero designs are really good too, Im having a ton of fun. 

Although I need to point out the optimization is fucking awful. I can't stream this game without it crashing my entire pc every time I load into a match. It's a new game so poor optimization is expected, and my graphics card is now 6 years old so I need a new one, but considering I play Overwatch at a consistent 240 frames while streaming and this one can't run above 80, it needs a lot of work. 

Not sure if this game will be as competitive of a game as Overwatch once was, but it has a lot of potential. Overwatch will always be closer to my heart, but this game has been fun.

I can only marvel at all of those rivals.

Great moments. Wish I could toggle HUD in replays though


very good game.

It runs like trash and i have a 2080 Super on my main PC

I LOVE THE NUDE SQUIRREL GIRL MOD!!!

whoever added the sjark can go eat a big ol bag of dicks

comp matchmaking is garbage

I play venom for that gyatt

that shark creature does not produce a positive emotion in me

this game is all about team work when none of your team dose a single fucking thing need to have to friends to play with yet they are ass to so must be this game

very good

F

cool

nice

very fun game would recommend, Venom is thicc

cool

Awesome! 
I love hero shooters, I've played OW since beta. OW is one of my favorite games of all time.
 
But Marvel Rivals are fresh, polished, and just fun to play. 
On top of that, they have a much better progression. 
Battlepass (at least first one) is affordable, completable in a reasonable time, and has no expiration date!

If they continue to add content and don't screw the pricing model,
I will be more than happy to pay them a "subscription" in the form of $5 battlepasses. 

I cant play this bitch ass game at all! MEMORY ERROR BITCH I HAVE A 4090?????? WHEN A DEVS GONNA FIX THIS

good

overwatch < marvil

very good

venom meat mod

THIS GAME NEVER LAUNCHES CORRECTLY, IT IS A POS.

NOM NOM NOM

Has no reason to be as graphics intensive as it is, especially given it's ugly designs.
Unbalanced and unfun gameplay.



game is gud

Jeff

Its alright, character kits are pretty interesting and takes awhile to get used to with the big pool
some characters are obviously overpowered as compared to others, could be better
matchmaking is quite skewed 50% of the time
cash shop prices are netease business as usual

spiderman

It's fun, easy to learn and everyone can play it. What's not to love.

NICE ART STYLE...

its fun

JEFF I LOVE JEFF

gud game

im terrible at it but its fun as hell

BEst Disney Princess game. Favorite Asian Princesses are Iron Fist from Mulan and the only Disney Korean princess pop star Seol Hee A.K.A. LUNA SNOW, STAN LOONA- I MEAN STAN LUNA!

very very fun game

GOOD

I AM THE FIST OF KHONSHU, I TEAR THROUGH THE CLOUDLESS NIGHT!

 I am also very concerned that they will change and somehow worsen the game with an update or something.
It is soo perfect and fun, been some time since I had fun playing video games, really made me remember why I like them.
Thank you. 10/10

I have spent way too much time playing ironfist is a bitch 10/10 love suffering

In my first thoughts i was scared that this game will be worse than actual overwatch 2 but good that i was wrong game is very good, they could spend more time in balance but overall this game is good, I recommend this game to everyone who loves overwatch just like me! ❤❤❤💖🐱‍👤🐱‍👤😘

Yes sir this is a great game Yes it has some flaws but there is like no online game that don't have any flaws

Really good game if you like working 8+ hours to come home to some mouth breather with 18hrs on spider-man already that goes 32-4 on you

Honestly, was weary of the game due to its similarity to overwatch 2. But, after getting it, can confirm that Marvel Rivals is just amazing. It's just such a fun game, and since I'm a Marvel fan, it was an amazing gift to have. I give it a 10/10.

Overwatch sucks

Jeff

Due to the state of current released games, I went into Rivals with some doubt (especially after playing Overwatch for a few years and noting the challenges that game has faced). I have to say, without a doubt, that this game is SO fun. Its free, has a cheap battle pass, offers awesome cosmetics, feels relatively balanced (for a game just released), loads into matches quickly, and has a great art style.  I am having trouble with ranked ques, as many people auto lock DPS and there are some fairly toxic people, but overall it has not ruined my experience. I hope that this game continues to grow, because I can see myself playing it for a long time!

overwatch 1.2


surprisingly good marvel shooter

ACT LIKE AN ANGEL AND DRESS LIKE CRAZY

its good but needs a higher skill cap, especially for some point and click ults


This game is literally knock off paladins except marvel characters 
Ofc the game made by chinese people is temu quality

fbnm

love this game

Win or lose, had fun

It's a pretty decent hero shooter.

Just released, so the playerbase is huge. Game takes a second to find a qp/arcade match.

Characters looks and feels decent to play. Some may feel a bit OP at the moment but that's alright, playing against OP characters and coming up with strategies to defeat them is what makes the game fun. Besides, it all comes down to team play, if you have a bad team, its gg anyway. And since they are from Marvel universe there's already some interesting lore. What I liked about this game is that you can access everything(comics and lore stuff) in game, instead of having to go through opening up your browser and getting redirected to some other website which can at times become annoying. 

Now the bad parts. Since this runs on UE5, it is NOT optimized for low-end hardware. I've seen various threads on sites where people can't run this game on integrated graphics and some even mentioned facing crashes on high-end hardware. As this is purely a Online PvP game, this might hurt the game's user-base down the line. Devs will need to work on the optimizations more.

And there's waaaaay toooo many different currencies, which ultimately becomes very confusing. Should I use "chrono whatever" or the blue coins to buy a skin? What's up with the gold ones? Just keep it between 1 or 2 to make things easier to understand.

All in all, it's a much better alternative to overwatch. For now.

jeff

Poorly Optimized Garbage.
FUCK JEFF THE LAND SHARK.



is gud

free fun thats enough

gud

Is very gooooood.

very good game

ARMED AND DANGEROUS

iT GuD

Great multiplayer game just for the sheer fun of it. They mostly nailed the Marvel hero feeling but I think most people who enjoy hero shooters will be sucked in.

so frustrating but i like it

Groot needs to reload. Do what you will with that information.

fuc* overwatch

IT'S MAHVEL BABY

The game freezes and crashes constantly. it is not playable.

Better than Overwatch!

No one is woke and there are no fat people. 10/10

fun game

nice change of pace


its a free hero shooter with marvel characters whats not love about it besides getting destroyed by the opposing team

Very fubn

I can't believe that there's finally a good new hero-shooter for the first time since Overwatch came out and it's a soytastic Marvel game. I could have never guessed that I would love this game as much as I do.

jogo bom

yes sir

good

very good game, makes me forget about my divorce

every hero or villain is broken, that's why I am having so much fun

dogshit game infested with valorant cucks who spew their dogshit lingo

12/10 wayyyyy better than phasmophobia


Marvel Rivals is a great game, there is a lot going on when you first start battling but you will get used to it

characters make no sense. Game is chuns. Just go play overwatch

Cool and familiar characters, not too many random ones.
Marvel IP is a great way to push new players to this game.
IMHO better than Overwatch. Enjoy playing solo or queue with friends.
I don't buy season passes or anything of the sort, this game was free and season pass was 10 bucks. Tried it and am happy I did.

better than ow

overwatch killer

Got a punishment becuase the game glitched and didnt let me select a hero. not changing my review until thats fixed

yeth


This game makes me want to kill myself :)

REMOVE PSYLOCKE

 Jeff is love
Jeff is life

yes

eats

Good game but i've crashed a lot, if i got a dollar for each time i crashed is probs have about $50 by now.. destructible environment is fun. Very easy to dislike that lil jeff fella but hes too cute i dont know how to feel about him anymore. such goodness but so confusing helpo.

Jeff

this game ass

clunky

fun

i like sharks

Great game, great content. 
Fun competitive match. better then Overwatch2 so far !

I Just wish the ban phase for every rank and not diamond + only.

Marvel Rival is like chess man the heroes are way cooler , great strategy , epic fights. 10/10 "The moon hunts you "

nice

fuck that shark

JEFF

An OP, easier version of TF2/OW-style gameplay with the same tedious, sensory overload of non-stop, tendonitis-induced shooting of shields and over-healed enemies coupled with the staple audio-clutter of characters yelling out one-liners every 2 seconds where the only bit of respite comes after death and on the way out of spawn.

For anyone looking to play this style of game, this might be a good place to start as a modern take of it.

For anyone looking to rekindle this genre or a change in formula, this won't really do much of that. 

TL;DR: Same sh*t, different dev.
TL;DR 2: Too jaded for this sh*t

Jeff the Shark ate my entire team so I shape shifted from Loki into Jeff the Shark and ate him back saving my team. Peak gaming.

Bootyful game

Everything good i want jeff to bite the curb tho

this game is suck keep crashing

It genuinly is just a top 10 game


Rubber banding, lagging, stuck loading, realising the last 15 seconds of gameplay never happened as you revert back to spawn, or just straight up crashes. 50% of the time it's fun, the other 50% you'll just waste your time.

peak


its fun

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

nice game

This game is literally just full of Bots cant understand why ppl really enjoy this more than Overwatch

great job

Dont play this game if u dont have a team.. If u go solo there will always be 2-3 smurfs in opp team,probably people with no life.

Jeff

GREAT

When are they adding Big Wheel?

jeff

wow

Probably the best PVP game i ever played much better than OW and The Finals.

I hate the free-to-play model but the game itself is p sick tbh

Baller

İ cant quit this mf

fun

very promising game { definitely better than overwatch }

Incredible hero shooter its like Overwatch but balanced.

This is crack cocaine made in a South Compton trap house in the 80's

This game is super fun gameplaywise and is much better than overwatch, But the community and players are the same players from overwatch. Players are either stupid and toxic and only in rare cases they are positive, Also the requirement for ranked play is too small and i think it should be forced role queue in ranks under gold 3

most shit ass game I think I've played, I would rather play Overwatch at this point because at least in Overwatch shit makes sense instead of this horrible piece of trash

Horrible optimized game, i really enjoy playing it but its genuinely unfair how much it crashes my pc, i have a 5700 and 3060 with 12 gb of memory and still get constant stutters and gpu crashes, fixed every setting known to man as well, really dissapointing

ye


great game bad optimization though


Better than Overwatch in every measurable way

more magik

If you're starting off completely new, you're put against players who simply decimate your entire team. This happened three times in a row to me, the only three games I played.

It's also horribly unoptimized, probably because there's too much spyware running in the background.

fuuck you jeff

Fuck this game honestly i think everyone should play it

good and fun

Better than overwatch.

Game is fun, as a Paladins and Overwatch player im really enjoying it, the game just works! unlike the other 2... would like to see role Q in ranked tho

I can finally play as one of the heroes I've seen in the movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe! I can play as Iron Man, Magneto, Thor, Captain America, and more! Ever since I was young, I’ve dreamed of flying like Iron Man—this game makes that dream feel real! It’s amazing how these characters have inspired me over the years, and now I get to experience a little bit of that magic myself.  ;’D

Review Score: 89

good I hate typing

AGAIN!

AGAIN

GAME is fun and amazing also the details is incrediable

way better than overwatch 2

keeps crashing pc after multiple optimizations. horrendous. F*** this game

Amazing game

goat

this game is amazing

I am Iron Man

Its like overwatch but good

The only thing it needs is a buff to vanguards to make tanks more fun to play. Same with supports

Spiderman is very fun

nice

hi so much fun. stan blackpink.

Just same old DPS needs to op "team" game

Just hope you dont get 4 damages before you even get to lock in :P

awesome game ... beats overwatch x 1000

FPS completely ruined after update, unplayable

it is a good game


kk

trash game

it is fun

JEFF SINGING IS SO CUTE

Absolutely horrendous optimization, i have a ryzen 7 5700x 16gb 3200mhz and an rx 6700xt, i get 150-180 fps, but it drops fps and stutters so much on lowest settings.

Would be a great game if they can optimize it.




better than overwatch

it's good

SMASH

s

Every character is fuckin broken lmao it's good fun

FEAR MAGNETO

goated game

tremble before bast

I heard Iron Fist, Scarlet Witch, Iron Man Ults in one game
please let me die

really enjoy how the balance is around everyone being "overpowered", besides obvious things like some people needing buffs this game is fun to play

i think the only thing i dislike is the rotational season buffs (+150hp, 20% dmg, 15% healing boost), this feature needs to go away

The art style got me.

h

fye fye fye

fart

Cerified Overwatch "2" grave pisser.

After 69 hours i can finally say that this game is overwatch but with marvel characters.  

have a great day :D


amazing game but poor graphics optimization

waawaaawawawa waaa wawawaa wawa awwaaa

wow amazng

 amazing game would 100% recomend!


Game is fun when u have  a team that isnt total bumwater, as a support main i can only do so much and when i have most the kills 7 out of 10 games its a problem, this game desperatly need role locks and sbmm, tired of carrying as Loki like wtf

Very cool game. Wish it didn't crash so much but I love it so far.

I have a mommy kink now. 10/10

i HATE hawkeye.

greatest game of my life

good but needs optomising so my pc can run

Jeff

Nice & Cool

Thank you Marvel Rivals for slowly bricking my pc with these crashes, pc froze writing this review (after also freezing on marvel rivals)

biggest gripe is its full of fortnite Timmys who boot the game and go "OmG i CaN pLaY aS sPiDeR mAn!?!?!" and then just run into the enemy team and kill themselves rather then actually playing. its a team based game, where your team never helps. *cough cough* role based match making could fix that slightly but the devs think its a sin to add. not to mention game runs poorly. in order to get it to run well, i have to lower settings, and that ok except the ui gets blurry and actually unreadable? how, how do you mess that up?. healing is to fast and makes flanking/punishing feel like a chore as the enemy healer will full heal them within a second. also, there is almost no visual indicator that the player is low health, like a red screen when low health, so some times it feels as if you can pick a fight but your 1 shot and dont realize it. game has like 30 heros to play, but some feel bland and without a proper kit, like jeff or black widow, then other heros will have like 6 abilities making them feel like a must pick. game just feels scrapped together at times. also honestly, marvel feels so over saturated and im getting tired of it in general. welp, hero shooter number 1463 is not fun, who would have guessed.

I will leave the cat here, so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up.

its amazing thats realy it but i realy want deadpool in the game

Its fun

It's fun.

Game is absolutely phenomenal, but it's unoptimized and we are unable to disable certain graphical features that we may not want

its pretty cool

Jarvis, clip that

yes

shitty game

LOVE IT

good game

I love the Venom Mod

BEST GAME OF 2024

This scratches the overwatch itch.

really loved it, FU*K IRON FIST

i ate 4 as jeff the best game ever

just crashes on startup everytime.

I had a dream, I was Blackwidow beating the hell out of a squirrel lady!

its overwatch but better

its a great game if you like marvel

Never playing overwatch again

ARMED AND DANGEROUS

yes yes skibidi toilet :0


super hero seggs seggs

Good game but some of the characters are way too unbalanced

Awesome sauce

matchmaking is so bad

Great game overall. I like the visuals, sounds, gameplay.
Some of the characters are more broken than others e.g.: Iron Fist, Spiderman, Black Panther
They can easily oneshot you in 1 second with a single combo. Escaping from them is almost impossible even as a high mobile character

i am iron man


yes

rautamies

It's an amazing game and I love the art and the way the characters play.

very addicting

nice

w

Be playing support
Get targeted by flying kung-fu man and angry woman with a sword
Die
Repeat

10/10 would recommend

ili

Fun game!!

better than Overtrash 2 :)

game has tons of potential. way more fun than overwatch. need more maps.


Initially a good game, but gets boring very fast within a few days after playing. 
Wouldnt invest in the long-run. 
There are no good fps games generally at this period, so I would still come back to Marvel Rivals from time to time for quick matches. 


noice geme

cons:
bad performance: ~90fps on lowest settings and 70% res scale with 1080ti
for example in apex ~160fps, overwatch2 ~220fps, paladins +175fps etc. - but all those games look much better at low to medium settings.

bad game design: abilities completely op - leads to boring and passive gameplay with autoattacks until ult charge full, then push with ult and again passive until ult etc. 

pro: art style

fun asf

new gen version of overwatch

h

not enough feet

Another garbage repetitive and boring game where the female characters have sexually idealized body parts. Developers who make such games are disgusting people and should change somthing in their life or quit making such offenside games! I will never touch this game again anyway.

I mean its alr ig

i play game, game fun, game make mad sometimes, but game fun

Marvel, good gameplay, and a nice polished original artstyle.

no cross plat play in ranked, but in quick play its ok? are you guys mentally deficient?  oh and the game development mindset behind the ults, lets just one shot everything cuz its an ult. jesus christ

very fun

game keep crashing . fuck unreal, did everything i could. update windows, graphics driver, lower in-game graphics settings, file integrity checked. and still no fix. 

It's free, it works great and it has Groot! Is there anything else that needs to be said?! Did I mention free (and Groot)?

Fun gameplay! If you like OW this is a great game for you.

good

Finally a good one of these games

Best game

The matchmaking in this game is so terrible. They got me teaming up with bums all the time

good

Venom Mod

Game is really fun but extremely unbalanced for ranked play. They need to balance for ranked play but otherwise its a very fun game

Edit: I stand corrected. They need to heavily balance the game for ranked. There is nothing fun about ranked but everything is fun in quick play. Ranked is literally 18X worse than any ranked mode in any game I've ever played

V GFOUyyfg

I'm having the time of my life on this game, I was gonna start playing overwatch but nah this is the game.

Every character has at least one way to be good.

Game is fuckin sick

Awesome game!

noice booty gayme must try


Besides Jeff, this game is decent.

i dont get whats the hype with this game. the game itself aside of having cool graphics, is quite boring. third person shooter, not really fast paced. abilities all sound annoying. and somehow the game feels unfinished. like an early access. despite feeling familiar to Overwatch, it lacks something, something i cant quite find what it is.
But hey at least female characters have nice physics. riiiiight-

I fucking hate jeff

Since it uses unreal (how bad this sh*t is) engine 5, the performance for a game like this is not even close. It also means that i get random crashes, which also happen to my friends, saying something about GPU dump.(tried to fix it, by increasing tdrdelay and removing oc, without any luck)

The maps aren't that great and really streamlined, not much chances for flanks or interesting plays that interact with the map. 

The fact that this game already released with more dps characters than tanks and supports is just a terrible decision. Supports also have the most impactful abilities, while tanks are pretty mediocre(besides doctor strange). 


If it wasnt for the marvel ip, this game would be in the negatives review wise.

ARMED AND DANGEROUS

fuck jeff and wanda and iron fist

The art style is beautiful and the game play is fun

I´ve always wanted a marvel themed game that could make me feel like the super heroes i liked the most AND FINALLY, that game exists right now.
I´ve been enjoying it so FREAKING much, its like a dream come true, i truly recommend it :3

Can't recommend the game in its current state. Game would stutter a lot and can't even play. Some random luck it would run normally one match only to stutter again the next match. I even upgraded my GPU for this game but still can't fix it.

addictive

its great, idk what other things to say, I have onlz little of playtime but its reallz great and i think i will continue playing it. one little thing that bothers me is that some heroes are EXTREMELY op. like kills you in one shot

m likey it good

actually a fun free game what's there not to like??

If you want to play an Overwatch style game that looks worse, feels worse, runs like shit, is completely unbalanced and broken, and gives you constant no regs this is the game for you!

jarvis, show me bruce's balls

this was really fun. Great release. Probably the best multiplayer shooter release for me after Valorant.

Better than Overwatch 2

feels like 2016-19 overwatch again

Big good. Very fun. Iron fist go bonk.

This game just makes me wanna play overwatch again.

Great game to just play with friends. With the Marvel IP, incredible potential with a variety of characters to choose from. Needs a few QoL reworks here and there but other wise better than a lot of live service games out there

great character models and skins are great

shark

Spiderman

WE. ARE. VENOM!

good game blizzard bad

FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.

Marvel Avengers is so immersive that when I play as Hulk, even my keyboard starts smashing itself

Very fun.

Better then overwatch. 
Atm you can just buy the stuff you want. No lootbox stuff.

Will go back to playing some with friends for sure.

best game i love u devs this is the best game ever made 10x better than ow2 valorant csgo fortnite every game to ever exist play it NOW!

I like this game

Not  bad, but maybe need some improvements for the mid end pc / laptop, overall its a great game..

Hela is balanced trust

The matchmaking sucks every match is one sided and the game needs anti-healing abilities tanks go from 3hp to full in seconds

I played only to see if the game lived up to the hype, and yes it does.
I don't put efforts in competitive games anymore as I don't have time for it, but the game as unique mechanics 
 and a great roster of free characters covering all roles and playstyles, making it EASY to sink hundreds of hours in such a well-rounded title.


Punisher too fun

The goat

overwatch but better

Very fun to play with friends!

nice game

[h1]Making all 30+ characters available at launch, non-FOMO battlepass systems (THE BP WILL NEVER EXPIRE), being able to convert the in-game currencies 1:1 (premium and free) should be the new industry standard!

[b]This is a game that respect your time and grind.[/b] [h1]

I’ve Played both previous playtest for a good amount (unlocked the permanent rewards from them), and I can say that even now, after the official release, this game really scratches the old-school Overwatch itch that I've been having for a while.

Characters are well-designed and fun to play, not to mention that they're all free from the start.
While I'd love for cosmetics to be cheaper (because I could see myself buying some of them eventually), they are actually similar to Fortnite's skin prices and come in a bundle with other items.

Another plus is that if you decide to buy the Battle Pass, you can continue to unlock rewards even after the pass itself has ended, which does combat FOMO.

Overall, I've not had any technical issues and have been having a blast playing this with friends.

Fingers crossed NetEase won't mess this up, and that we'll get more mutants, like Cyclops, Jubilee, and Nightcrawler.

Very fun and free hero shooter, with every character unlocked from the start — a Battle Pass that never expire, and a license they can expand on for potentially years to come.

There's room for both optimization and balancing, but equally crucial with a game like this — and one thing they absolutely nailed, is server capacity. I've not been disconnected [i]once[/i] since launch. Great job.

I'm leaving a positive review just for how well the servers work on launch with millions of players. I've had 0 issues across the board connecting to matches, friends, etc. No weird drops, nothing. Other AAA studios should take note on how to launch a title like this!

I hope it doesn't go through the same fate as Overwatch, where the people who make Overwatch porn work harder than the people who make Overwatch

Feels good to be back in a an OW style game. Character synergies and breakable environments are great additions to the game play style. Maps are well laid out and look fantastic. FK Blizz/Activis

Really fun game that has a good mix of casual play but that still has room for high ceiling and tactical plays with a lot of gameplay variety by having a truckload of heroes to choose right from the bat in which all of them play in a really different way even if they are within the same roles (e.g. Healer, Initiator, Tank, etc).

The art style and graphics in general are awesome and fortunately the performance is also working flawlessly even when considering how good it looks and due to dealing with the amount of crazy transitions and huge amount of effects on screen (both in-game and UI/Menus).


All heroes are available for free without having to deal with unnecessary grind or draconian unlock requirements. The only purchases are cosmetics (Skins, Emotes, Icons, Banners, MVP celebration) and Battle Passes, which those will not expire so no need for anyone to worry about FOMO, plus they seem to be decently priced (5 for the Season 0 and afterwards the usual 10). 

To note that the standard hero designs are pretty cool so the option to get skins is completely optional and it already shows that they will take inspiration from all over the media such as Classic Comics, original new based on specific themes, more mainstream ones such as the ones based on MCU movies and TV shows, etc; so if there's an already existing specific design someone really enjoys for a character it should be just a matter of time until it appears in the game as a Skin.

Game dev done right.

Whoever green lit this game to launch at this state deserves a enormous raise. Feels like what Overwatch 1/2 should have been. All characters are available at the start, the battle pass system is legitimately innovative (None of that FOMO crap and according to other reviews. We can still claim after the pass expires) and overall gameplay is fun and easy to learn. 

Your grind feels like it matters to be perfectly honest with this game.

This game and what is has done on launch alone. Should be the gaming industry standard for this genre.


All characters unlocked will make the game 10 times better in the long run,trust me and Remember what they did wrong in Overwatch 2

WHY PLAY THIS AWESOME NEW GAME ???

I Hope it doesn't meet the same fate as Overwatch !

Very good and clean game. However there is lag spikes and FPS drops.

It's like Overwatch but it doesn't make me want to put my **** in the blender. 

Also tons of baddies.

You don't need to know anything about Marvel to enjoy it. If you can shoot straight and figure out abilities you will have fun.

good game but please stop using UE5. TAA/upscaling is killing visual clarity and i should not struggle to get 110 fps when my visual settings makes the game look like TF2.

Aight marvel, wrap it up. Add deadpool to the game and make him like reaper from ow and im playing this game eternally.

Ever since they killed Overwatch, I've been looking for a game to scratch that itch, and this is it.

Playing this game reminds me of the first time I played Overwatch, and it fills the hole left by that game turning to shit

Incredibly fun to play with a delightful artstyle

Considering the hero shooter genre itself fell off during the rise of battle royales, it feels refreshing to have a return to the genre these past few years especially with Overwatch 2 and also finally have actual competition within the genre with Marvel Rivals. Marvel Rivals doesn't exactly do anything new within the genre but yet it feels unique and has potential considering the Marvel IP they have with a huge variety of characters to choose from.

While I am enjoying the game, I won't be glazing Marvel Rivals or downplaying Overwatch in this "review". I'm just here to talk about some concerns that I have regarding the future of the game.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Optimization[/h3]
It's running Unreal Engine 5 so it's no surprise that there's performance issues with the game especially on lower-end hardware but considering it's a game with a competitive mode, I feel optimization should be a priority for the game. A lot of the negative reviews on the game, at least on Steam, are talking about constant crashes, stuttering, low performance, graphics cards running out of video memory.

[h3]Visual Cues[/h3]
When you get hit in any game, there's almost always a "hit indicator" showing the direction of the damage and where it's coming from. These hit indicators in the game feel a bit off, sometimes it tells you the correct direction and other times it shows a completely different direction even though you can see where the enemies' hits are coming from.

You can test this within the practice range, at more than 5m range it tells you the correct direction - you get hit by in front of you, it'll show the correct hit indicator above the crosshair to indicate it's coming from in front of you and if you move your camera around, the hit indicator will rotate around your crosshair correctly.

However, when you go into melee range even if you get hit directly in front of you, the hit indicator will be shown on the bottom left of  your crosshair and when you move around your crosshair or model it'll still show an incorrect hit indicator. You could argue that the hit indicator is based on the center of your character's model but you can just play around in the practice range, move your character and camera around to see that it's a little inconsistent. It's a little hard to explain in text considering it's a visual cue so it's more of a "seeing" thing but I feel the hit indicator should register based on your camera angle rather than your character model (if that is actually the case).

[h3]Balancing Concerns[/h3]
Currently in Season 0, it sort of feels like "everyone is OP therefore no one is OP" that some games like Dota are designed around, but that's probably just people trying out different characters while it's still fresh. That said, there are some that are stronger than others, especially because of the yellow icon on the corner of the character portrait called a "Season Boost" where vanguards get bonus health, duelists get bonus damage and strategists get bonus healing.

Personally, I feel it is a lazy way to buff certain characters, especially long-term when players are more familiar to the game and get more sweaty. It's an artificial way to tell players "play this character this season, we buffed them." There are some characters that would feel less playable without the Season Boost such as Venom or Thor who are just squishy without the bonus health that I feel they should just add the health to their base kit.

On the other hand, there are some heroes that are exceptionally strong because of the Season Boost, namely duelists such as Hawkeye, Hela and Iron Fist which make them unfun to play against. Rather than relying on Season Boosts to further buff a character, just buff their base kit/numbers or around their Team-Ups. Regardless of whether the game balance will lean towards a more casual direction or a more competitive environment like Overwatch, I don't think Season Boost is a good idea.

[h3]Role Issues[/h3]
Marvel Rivals currently has a role issue where a majority of the players just wants to play duelist (damage/dps), and then proceeds to ask for someone else to pick a vanguard (tank) and strategist (support). One factor is that, as of launch, there are only 8 tanks and 7 supports compared to the 18 damage characters in the roster of 33 characters so there's more characters for players to try out and find their main.

Another contributing factor is a lot of the recognizable fan favourite characters within the Marvel Universe are duelists: Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Black Panther, Wolverine. Sure, you have some fan favourites in the other roles such as Captain America, Thor, Loki, but their kits just aren't as appealing as the duelist characters.

In all fairness, in any game within any genre that has roles, people tend to lean more towards damage characters or roles more because it's just more fun seeing big damage numbers rather than protecting the team through damage blocked or healing provided numbers.

That said, speaking of the solo tank experience: In Overwatch 2's case, the solo tank role has too much responsibilities that it's just generally unfun for the average player regardless of what hero they enjoy playing. While Marvel Rivals is still relatively a new game, the solo tank experience here feels so much better than in Overwatch 2. In its current state, there's no counter-picking, no anti-healing, no excessive crowd control, which are the three main issues of the solo tank experience in Overwatch 2.

On the other hand, solo supporting in Marvel Rivals is just unfun. Yes, there are some characters that can output healing as much as two supports like Jeff, Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow (and maybe some other characters too if you try hard enough) but the unfun part comes when you get enemies that have at least two characters that dive you while your team of five duelists blame you for the lack of healing as they refuse to swap off even if they're going 0-10-0.

Of course, all these issues can be reduced by "just" playing in a party but that doesn't fix the issues - it's just putting a bandaid over a big problem. I personally don't think role queue is the solution to this, as I feel that would reduce the game's uniqueness since it'd basically be following Overwatch's route and possibly increase queue times. However, I think there should be some form of role restrictions, perhaps a "minimum 1 per role" or "maximum 3 per role" sort of thing.

[hr][/hr]

Hero shooter is one of my favourite game genres and it's nice to see a return to the genre especially after Overwatch 2's lack of exciting seasonal updates and "monopoly" over the genre, Paladins' lack of polish, Team Fortress 2's lack of update since Jungle Inferno back in 2017. As someone who started playing Team Fortress 2 back in 2010, enjoyed Gotham City Impostors, Gigantic, Monday Night Combat while they were popular, Marvel Rivals is a nice addition to the genre and definitely a much needed competition for Overwatch 2 in order for both and even upcoming games to try and compete with each other.

Really fun so far. Runs well on my pc. No major bugs so far, will update if that changes. 

So far a really great launch.

Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right. I have never seen such a purposeful, thought-out marketing plan in all of gaming. From the teasers, to the full trailers, the betas, the "leaks", to the surprise reveals. You have stirred up a hype storm the likes of which I've never seen with a decent chance on delivering all promises on release. Regardless of how the game turns out, this is going to be a HUGE opening week. Hats off Netease, just make sure not to drop the ball.

edit: they said sorry good enough W dev

Its a fun game however when crashing and disconnects is common don't ban me for 5 mins. unreal engine 5 is throwing a fit try's to rejoin or load game back in under 30 seconds. Oh that's to late you were already replaced. you cannot rejoin even when they give the option to. then you get 5 min penalty. My only ranked loss is a game I never got to join. It DC to main menu I try reconnect within seconds it says no -RP and ban timer for you. fix these issues either the crashing or don't ban and ill change to thumbs up.

super refreshing to play such a large pvp game that actually favors fun over anything, destructable environments and synergy cooldowns are also very cool ideas and i think they are executed pretty well
i hope they fix the bad optimization and i hope they dont go all esports mode on me but as it stands im a big fan

UE5 game so optimization is bad, and updates are heavy.
Lack of tank and support players..
But it has JEFF THE LAND SHARK!!

game is pretty good! reminds me of what overwatch used to be... you know: "FUN" 

buuuut it could use some work; some games i can run the game smooth with 0 problems but sometimes the game have those insane fps drops... its annoying af

It's a very fun fresh new game. It has some rough edges here and there, but overall it's a very enjoyable experience playing solo or with friends. You should give it a try.

Marvel Rivals was a game I was on the fence about trying. I wasn't really sure if I would have fun. I wasn't really sure if I was going to be forced to "be the best" at what "role" you choose, like Overwatch (2). I gave it a go last night and let me tell you... I had an absolute blast playing it! 

Before I get into it a quick disclaimer!

[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] 

[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] 
⚫The game's battlepass never expires. This should be "industry standard" for the more casual player, or at least let us swap between battlepass's when they come out.
⚫THERE IS NO FOMO!!!
⚫The price of bundles/monetisation is extremely well balanced. You are not charged an extortionate amount of money for an "ultimate" skin. Think Overwatch 2's mythic skins which are pure greed.
⚫You can get the "premium" currency via a 1-1 conversion rate. So if you earn the FREE currency, say you have 100 of it. You can convert all of this into PAID currency on a 1-1 ratio.
⚫ALL heroes are unlocked from the very start of the game. Yes, that's correct. All 35 are unlocked. Unlike Overwatch 2.
⚫The amount of different combat "approaches" you can have while playing this game is insane. Like, you can play Iron man and rain death from above. You can play Thor and devastate your enemies with an array of melee attacks. To playing spider-man, swinging around doing his "AMAZING" combo. So much potential here!!
⚫Each "tank", "healer", "dps" e.t.c offer a unique different playstyle which you can tailor to how you play and find one you like.
⚫The Art style of the game is also pretty damn good and it all just... works flawlessly. There is so much chaotic mayhem happening at any given time, the transitions, the map destruction... it all just works seamlessly. Have a look at Thor, I just LOVE the way he looks: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3379535150 
⚫All standard skins seem to be nice looking. No "pack" is advertised or SHOVED down your throat to purchase when logging in. All optional. Like, just have a look at Iron Mans skin, and read the quote: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3379535432 
⚫No character is "sexualised" like The First Descendant or Overwatch 2 showing us that the people that ACTUALLY made this game, know who their target audience is and WHAT they are doing.
⚫Marvel Rivals is unbelievably well optimised. I haven't had a single issue and neither has my friends which is astounding. We all have different PC setups so the fact that none of us have issues.... wow.
⚫ITS FREE-TO-PLAY!!! So, in the end... you're loosing nothing so why not give it a shot.

[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1] 
⚫There are some characters that do need a little bit of a nerf/buff or some balancing. 
⚫Sometimes it's kind of hard to tell who is "ulting" because they all kinda sound the same.

Personally, I don't see anything else wrong with it. This is my opinion after all.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
Marvel Rivals is the definition of "GAME DEVELOPMENT DONE RIGHT" and this should be the INDUSTRY STANDARD on paid items and battlepass's, ESPECIALLY the currency conversion (1-1) free - paid or vice versa. This is probably one of the most talked about things I have seen so far.

I am really looking forward to playing more of this and I cannot wait to see who they add next or what direction this game will go in! My only hope is that they continue to add in PROPER comic related skins and characters and not charge us £90 for a myhtic skin (wonder what game I'm talking about eh).

[h1][b] 9/10. A Free-to-Play game done RIGHT by passionate developers that actually care about the player and game! [/b][/h1]

If I'm being honest I don't think it's as good as Overwatch was, 
but it's better than Overwatch is.

Marvel Rivals totally gives me that awesome rush I felt when I first jumped into Overwatch back in 2016. It's kinda hard to put into words, but this game is just totally fun. The gameplay is so dynamic in keeping you hooked to its fast-paced action that genuinely makes your time. Every game feels like a new experience, and how the cool powers of each hero mesh with the game plan of the team—I don't remember what it's called, but basically, it's a synergy system where you unlock awesome skills if you have the right heroes—is super thrilling. Anyways, it definitely has that same feeling of excitement from the early days of Overwatch as I'm switching between heroes and testing them out (30+ heroes unlocked from the start, no battle pass bs).

Every hero pretty much feels like an actual super hero.

If there ever was an overwatch killer this is clearly it.

Blizzard needs to take notes.

I wanna say that I really, really enjoy this game. I have ALMOST no complaints, but the one that I do have is a dealbreaker. I cannot play this game. I am having a problem where, instead of loading into a match, my loading screen becomes stuck at 99%, and IF I ever get into the match, it isnt until about a minute after the round has started, or sometimes even into the second round. Again, thats if I get into the match at all. Ive been reported for this which, yes, is insane for a game that doesnt even have a competitive gamemode yet, but regardless its an issue that desperately needs addressing. It seems like something a lot of people are dealing with, but once it gets fixed I have no problem recommending this game to everyone.

Furthest thing from a Marvel fan, but this game feels really smooth and honestly plays really well?

Pretty impressed by it, give it a shot!

Constant crashing, the game is fun tho but I'm getting restrictions due to crashes so I can't even play :)

EDIT: The game is still crashing but I'm addicted. Ban system in high MMR is cool, should've added that to all ranks though.

Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right. I have never seen such a purposeful, thought-out marketing plan in all of gaming. From the teasers, to the full trailers, the betas, the "leaks", to the surprise reveals. You have stirred up a hype storm the likes of which I've never seen with a decent chance on delivering all promises on release. Regardless of how the game turns out, this is going to be a HUGE opening week. Hats off Netease, just make sure not to drop the ball

Wanted to change my review thank you Marvel Rivals for reaching out I can play again thank for caring about the community and the love and effort you put into the characters and their interactions with each over both gameplay wise and socially!

[h1]Current Take:[/h1]
After about 5 hours playing this it's pretty clear there's room for improvement and polish.  But honestly if they keep the new heroes coming and don't go backwards on their availability to players, they'll keep a playerbase long enough to really make this game something special by innovating and keeping things fresh with the "Team-Ups" mechanic (adding more, balancing existing, etc).  Here's to hoping they put "Get Help" in with Thor/Loki!

[h2]In other news, Path of Exile II drops in a little over 5 hours from now![/h2]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Initial Take:[/h1]
Marvel Rivals delivers a fast paced tactical team-based PvP experience in the Marvel Universe that gamers have wanted since Marvel Heroes Omega and Marvel Avengers died, especially since Marvel's Midnight Suns went full XCOM mode and PvE.

[spoiler]And that's not even really counting the gaping hole in the market, courtesy of the declining Blizzard Overwatch franchise... that we will not speak of![/spoiler]

[h2]Even if you don't care about all that, what else are you going to play until Path of Exile II comes out?[/h2]

I think the comparisons to other games are blown out of proportion. It's a great hero shooter that genuinely stands on its own and I would recommend to anyone!

Honestly, for a guy who has never been a Marvel fan. This game is great. 
Pros.
1. Loads of base roster characters, im sure they will add more.
2. Loads of different abilities, and play styles.
3. Maps are good.

Cons. 
1. This game i swear has some weird shader issues. (They might fix this later trust me it ain't my PC)
2. The combat and movement speed are so off. Almost like they don't work together they need to make the characters movement a little bit faster. 

Overall for a Marvel PvP i'm surprised how much they did get right. 
Lets hope this game lasts, we don't want it turning into something like Multiverses or take the path Overwatch did. 7/10

I’ve never watched a single Marvel movie, and here I am being dragged into the depths of this Marvel game, even though I couldn’t even name more than 3 characters before
But this ain’t gonna convince me to watch any Disney or Marvel movie—DON’T LET THIS GAME FOOL YOU

[h1] Has a long way to go [/h1]

It seems that there haven't been much improvements since the playtests. it's a decently fun game, especially when played with friends but it has a lot of issues that need ironing out. Right now, I cannot recommend this game in its current state.

[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Visual style is amazing! The characters, animations and effects are all very flashy yet cohesive. 
 - Good monetisation so far
 - Interesting characters. Decent mix of mainstream and obscure characters
 - Some character abilities are pretty unique and is a fresh take compared to other Hero Shooters
 - Team up abilities are interesting both from a gameplay and lore perspective. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - Poor optimisation. Lots of frame drops and sometimes the game just feels sluggish
 - Poor hit feedback. Most characters don't have impact sounds on hit and unless you're paying attention to enemy health bars closely, it's sometimes difficult to tell if you've actually landed a hit.
 - Poor audio mixing. Settings don't cover all parts of the game and certain parts are extremely loud when compared to others.
 - Voice lines give me secondhand embarrassment and most voice overs don't stand out.
 - Character movement is floaty and some heroes have way too many movement abilities when some of them could've been made into passives and less complex.
 - Maps are beautiful to look at but uncomfortable to traverse through. It feels like it would've suited a singleplayer game more. 
 - Needs better visual indicators for some enemy abilities
 
[b]The game is also balanced very poorly but that can be excused for now considering it only just released.[/b] 

So yeah, even though I had fun, there are parts of the game I find very dissatisfying and frustrating. Right now it feels like a 'Flavour of the Month' game than something I'd be playing long term. I do want this game to succeed and hopefully they iron out all these issues soon.

80% of these negative reviews are either trolls or OW cope, or are complaining about their potato computers not being able to run unreal 5. so i figured id actually give some legit criticism.
 Let me be clear i like this game and hope to see it improved. that being said it certainly has some issues.
First off, movement speed is far too slow and dose not match the speed of combat. there is almost no way to doge and or avoid like 40% of the stuff in this game. most of these characters are so slow its almost laughable.
2. "sniper characters" are too easy to use and are extremely hard to punish, no character is able to get to them without being shot and even when they do the snipers are still strong in close range, (specifically hawkeye). also hawkeye and black widows team up power is straight up busted, boarderline cheating.
3. there is too much visual and audio clutter, to many pointless voice lines going on. and why do i feel like i can't see my teams health bars half the time
4. the destructable terrain is cool but characters seem to get caught on "rubble" too much
5. Scarlet witch's ultimate is too strong she should not be able to move once activated. its too easy to hide behind a corner, activate it, then pop out right before it goes off and team wipe.
Again i actually like this game and it fills the hole of hero shooters but it needs so work. hope to see it improve other than that it is good casual fun. but as it is right now its a bit too unpolished to recommend.

The game is not optimized, so many games lost because people couldn't load in for the first few minutes or random spikes of lag. When were in between games the servers randomly bounce from us at 999 to Asia 999 and will settle down. I love the game itself and the heroes but when its bad, it is bad.

any photosensitive or epileptic gamer's looking to play this game - don't. I played for maybe half a game before I started experiencing warning symptoms and had to quit after attempting to look at hero cosmetics. Every menu, screen and sequence is absolutely riddled in flashing lights and bright impact frames with no way of disabling or skipping them.

A really fun game but unfortunately lacking entirely in accessibility, until features are added to accomodate I simply won't be able to play it.

I quite like this game, i've been craving a hero shooter and this one hits all the right spots.
i'm not really a marvel fan at all but i am a nerd and i've seen the movies, we all have, but i like the new designs (default skins) A LOT.
most of the payed skins ape off of the marvel and x men movies but i like the comic book inspirations a lot more, they look about as cool as the comic art as well.

the fast pace of the games is great, feels fair to lose, feels great to win.
The game is fast paced ranging from 6-10 minutes each, at least quickmatch, and i think it might have a fun E-sports scene as well, i'm certainly excited to see some games from people that dedicate their lives to the game.

The team up feature is incredible, i don't mind playing different heroes so i'm having a great time picking according to teammates picks, i can see it being really annoying for people that just wanna play their characters because team ups are just an advantage for most heroes, the hero GIVING the passive gets more damage or health, that is a huge advantage in a game with characters THIS squishy. so the meta might get a little stale unless a lot of these team ups change between seasons.

not all characters are built equal though, Hela is incredibly powerful, she really doesn't need all that health in her ult, meanwhile the melee champion Magik gets no extra health, seems a little weird to me. it takes the ENTIRE TEAM to blast Hela and her alone to kill her out of the ult while she can 2 shot healers and DPS, scarlet witch's ult can at least easily be cancelled if you focus her for second or 2.
(Hela is among my favorite characters to play, i'm not salty, i genuinely think it's too strong)

besides the mild balancing issues i bought the battlepass, they've adapted a form of the helldivers 2 progression system, and i don't like it entirely.
it feels a little disrespectful for a product i payed for, there's pages where you can buy items on, there's 5 tiers and you need to get those purple coins to progress the pass to the next tier, now there's a skin in the first 3 tiers however to get that skin you must purchase all the items in that tier including the skin, you will have to pick and choose and overachieve to get all items in the battlepass because opening up a tier happens before you get enough purple coins to buy all the items on that tier, it's telling me that they want my time, every day because you wanna do those daily challenges and events to get all the purple coins to get to the end.
despite the battlepass being available forever i still feel like i need to WORK to get it done, and work sucks, nobody likes work if they have a hobby.

regardless, i'm still enjoying the game and will probably continue to do so.

Undoubtedly one of the most fun live service multiplayer games to come out in the past few years. Just make sure you have a good graphics card before playing, as it's pretty intensive

Consistent crashes


EDIT** Even after doing your solutions, there is still consistent crashes even with the newest nvidia drivers. There has to be a memory leak somewhere that just completely screws me over after like 30-40 minutes of ingame time. I want to enjoy this game, but I am sick of getting kicked out of every damn match because of memory leaks or horrible optimization even on the lowest possible settings.

I'm being penalized because of faulty game development with Nvidia drivers which is odd considering how widely used these are in actual game development... I will not be touching this game until the aforementioned issues are resolved, this is honestly ridiculous, never had issues with ANTHEM:tm: and that ran so much worse then this.

First impressions of the game:

- Very fun to play so far even solo, but runs like crap.
- Beautiful animations & character models, very faithful to the source material, if you're a marvel comics fan you're in for a real treat!
- The battlepass, all the different currencies & unlocks are a bit too complicated for my taste, i still don't fully understand how everything works, do i need to buy the lower tiers to unlock the next one or can i save my currency? will i even be able to unlock all the "free" tiers by doing missions or do i need to pick and choose?
- Multiple visual/audio bugs & glitches.
- Trash servers that keeps kicking you 6 out of 10 times you try to start a new match (most likely due to them having 444k people in-game on Steam simultaneously earlier), sometimes you can reconnect, other times someone else will quickly take your spot and then the game will start threatening you for "leaving", haven't gotten a temp ban yet though.
(and no, it's not my internet, i'm not the only one affected & this is the only game where i've been experiencing any disconnecting issues.)
- The destructible environment is a cool element, but it seem to regenerate a little too fast?
- Some characters are way too slow imo, it can take you ages to get back to the action when you respawn.
- I really like the roster they have so far (i'm happy to see both Psylocke & Jeff The Baby Land Shark here) and i'm glad they didn't stick to only the well known MCU characters, it's also really nice of the devs to have them all unlocked from the get go, no unnecessary grind needed, can't wait to experiment with every single one of them!
- I can't comment on the balance yet as i only played for so little. (and i'm a filthy casual)

All in all, regardless of all the issues and lack of polish in some aspects, the game is FUN to play so far, and that's all it needs to be for me to recommend it & enjoy it, they managed to build a very solid foundation and i can't wait to see how they'll expand on it and what other Marvel heroes (and especially villains) they'll introduce in the future!
I have so much hope for this game, please don't fumble it like a certain other franchise everyone seems to hate now. *Cough Cough* *Overwatch* *Cough* 7/10

personally the game is just too visually cluttered for me to enjoy it not to mention lacking in feedback, I don't really feel it when I kill someone there's no real snappy sound effects on kill or headshot, not to mention everyone seems to have a nuclear option ability that just drops people instantly, everyone's squishy

The optimization is so horrible, i run 200+ on so many other games but on this one i hardly run 40

This game is incredible until Jeff eats your entire team and self suicides with them

Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun! I can finally stop feeling depressed by playing Overwatch. First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic—I just love it. Don’t even get me started on the characters; they’re incredible and 10 times better than anything I’ve seen, and the designs are especially top-notch. The launch was a very solid start with stunning visuals. The skins and battle pass are totally worth it. Plus, it's great to see a team that genuinely listens to the community, and thank God for that! Compared to other PvP shooters, Marvel Rivals stands out with its unique hero abilities and balanced gameplay. So, do I recommend this game? Just go for it. I bet you'll love it and keep playing it. I hope it just keeps getting better and better. Also, with new characters on the way, I can’t wait! Great job, NetEase Games! This game is so good, I clear my day for it.

As it is, the game is sadly unplayable for me. Will play a couple games, and then it crashes, punishing me for leaving the match. My computer is more than able to run games far more demanding than this, but due to poor optimization, I literally cannot play it.

In its current state, I sadly can't recommend this to anyone, even if it's a very fun game. Hope this is fixed soon, as from my research, it's been a problem since the beta.

optimization is really bad, forced taa, balancing is really bad, no role queue, destructible environment is really bad, so much visual clutter and aiming feels off in this game

i hate hero shooters but this game is so fun, i can see why former overwatch enjoyers are flocking here in droves. only issue is there's constantly a huge amount of auditory queues so its a little much at times but i actually really like it despite the characters always yapping

Game needs a LOT more optimisation. Good game but not at a playable state right now.

I actually really like the game, but I'm putting this review as negative in the hopes issues get noticed/taken seriously

The game needs role queue: its just like old OW days where people insta-lock dps and then get rolled by the opposing team for having an actually balanced comp. Not having it is terribly unfun and is harmful for the longevity of the game.

More options for tank and healer/support (goes with previous statement): upon release there are over 33 characters to select from... but only 15 of which are either a tank or support character. 55% of the characters in the game are dps characters. The game is seeing an insane amount of people playing only dps characters probably as a result, not to mention that its almost completely unrewarding to play support at all.

Optimization: I have the game set at all the lowest settings and can barely manage 55 fps while in game, sometimes seeing lows as far as 20 fps (although this is when everyone ults/spams abilities to be fair). The game at these settings aren't even that spectacular yet I can't manage to get many frames. While I don't have the greatest build, I don't have this issue with almost any other game I play, especially not on settings this low either.

Certain characters need to be balanced further: 
Storm seems really cool to play, but doesn't have nearly as much mobility as she should for how much damage she does and as much health as she has. I feel like a floating target waiting to be shot at. Personally, 10~15% extra damage, and or having a higher speed boost would feel quite nice on her. Her ultimate however is ridiculous and probably needs to be nerfed. I have seen 4 Storm ults be used, and each one was either a 4 or 5 man kill. It has a huge range, and does an absurd amount of damage in a short time.
Scarlet Witch if played like a flanker is difficult to deal with. She's easily in my top 5 characters due to her fade (with free flight) and her primary fire having decent range. While she's my favorite (and best character) she clearly needs a nerf, that being either longer cooldowns between her fades or a range reduction on her primary fire. Her ultimate is very powerful but balanced IMO as you have to be somewhat close to kill, and are slow flying in the air for what feels like 2 to 3 seconds ( a long enough time to get melted if the team sees you, which has happened to me a number of times).
Peni Parker needs balancing. I don't know what specifically (maybe a cap on the number of mines she can use) but anytime I use her, or the opposing team uses her, its GG. She's got very good CC, and decent mobility too with her web grapple. Not to mention her ability to tie people up momentarily, allowing your team to focus the binded target.
I don't feel like writing more of a novel, so some other characters I think need a look at are Hela (can two shot characters with primary fire),, Punisher (mostly his ult), Adam Warlock (OG Mercy rez is OP), Loki (clones are too good, healing potential/survivability is too high), Mantis (charm guarantees a kill), Moon Knight (while his ankhs can be destroyed quickly,  he can very easily rack up tons of damage on anyone inside of them even for that brief moment, even allowing players to get their ultimate just in the first fight of the match).
Other than that, I think tanks across the board need buffs (except Peni). No tank aside from Peni has had much pressure on any fight, or has created as much space in a fight as much as the dps have. It could be a lack of people's knowledge on the characters causing this issue, but I still think they feel pretty weak.

People saying they like this game are still in the "honeymoon" phase where everyone gushes over it. Once that's over this game will face the same problems with Overwatch and its balancing. Overtuned characters to hell and only listening to the wannabe e-sports players with no concern for the wider audience.

DX12 is not supported error message, even though DX12 IS supported by this system and has been used extensively for multiple games.

Multiple other errors being reported, ranging from normal connection issues with any initial startup to things like stuttering, gpu crashes, et cetera.

In terms of gameplay?  Uh...yeah, this is pretty meh.  Very average feeling, hitting things doesn't feel impactful, feedback is muted, maps are bland, game modes don't make you even think half the time.
Not the worst game I've played but I'd probably give this a 5 out of 10.

Game balancing issues caused by no locked roles, so people will flood a team with DPS and get absolutely nowhere because of it.

The game right now seems to be in a very very rough spot and definitely needs more time to cook.

This game is sick. Well made by the developers! Thank you! Cannot believe it is free and also the battlepass is so cheap! Very user friendly!

Game is fun but the needs to be optimized, its pretty much unplayable when team fights happen.

Constant disconnects. 

I have been disconnected from games more often than loading normally into a game. The disconnects fall into three main categories: 

The first is 0% the game starts to load into the match and gets stuck at 0% until I am kicked to lobby. This is nearly an 100% that I will be replaced and warned.

The second is 99% the game starts to load into the match and gets stuck at 99% until I am kicked to lobby. This allows me to sometimes get back into the game.

Finally the "skip" the game starts to load into the match and gets stuck with a "skip" button until I am kicked to lobby. Thankfully this one always allowed me to get back in and was most common.

Until today. Today I got disconnected, "skip", then tried to reconnect and got 0%'d, twice.
I tried to play 6 games today, and have only been able to get into 2 of them, #2 and #4. Disconnect #3 resulted in a warning and so did #5 and #6. Not even able to play the game and punished for trying.

Overwatch with Marvel Characters but not as good as the original Overwatch... A free to play to play hero shooter/slasher with skins to buy... Sure i would recommend it... Solid - 7/10

Marvel Rivals - A Disappointing Misfire in the Gaming Sphere

In the ever-evolving landscape of superhero games, expectations are high, especially when it comes to titans like Marvel and DC. However, "Marvel Rivals" is a glaring example of how misguided creative direction can lead to a product that feels more like an afterthought than a worthy addition to the genre. Unfortunately, this title seems determined to shatter any hopes fans had for an engaging multiplayer experience.

From the get-go, "Marvel Rivals" presents itself as an ambitious attempt to capture the dynamics of games like "Overwatch," but it falls woefully short. The promise of a strategic, hero-based shooter is drowned out by poor mechanics, uninspired gameplay, and a glaring lack of character depth. As players dive into the action, they quickly realize that the combat is clunky and unbalanced, with characters that feel like pale imitations of their comic book counterparts. Rather than a rich tapestry of heroes and villains, we are met with watered-down representations that do little justice to the legacies they are meant to embody.

Adding to the frustration is the management of the properties themselves. The decision to dilute beloved characters under the stewardship of figures like James Gunn and Marvel's creative leadership feels like a betrayal to long-time fans. The creative vision, or lack thereof, behind "Marvel Rivals" reeks of a rushed project that prioritizes quick profits over genuine storytelling or gameplay innovation. It's as if both franchises are in a race to see who can drive their beloved universes into the ground faster.

Moreover, the negative sentiment surrounding the current direction of these superhero narratives is palpable. Many fans echo the sentiment that the "cape shit" genre has reached its saturation point. With so many entries trying to capture the same formula, originality has taken a backseat, and unfortunately, "Marvel Rivals" is a testament to this decline. It makes one wonder if we are witnessing the end of an era rather than a renaissance for superhero games.

In conclusion, "Marvel Rivals" is a disappointing foray into a genre that once held so much promise. With lackluster gameplay, poor character portrayals, and a creative team that seems to be steering the franchise off a cliff, it is difficult to recommend this title to anyone. If this was meant to be the "Overwatch killer," it missed the mark by a wide margin. Perhaps it’s time to put the cape and cowl to rest and seek fresh horizons beyond the superhero realm. For fans seeking engaging gameplay, there are far better options available in the vast gaming universe.


It's fun for a while but it's got a lot of problems.

- Performance is bad even at 1080p low & frame generation for this kind of game makes things worse. You will not get 100+fps unless you have a high end system. This game is using a ton of new unoptimized unreal engine features. 
- Balance is... non existent. I think the devs just tried to make faithful & fun adaptations of all the heroes but the gameplay suffers because of this. If you tried to play this game as anything but casual certain characters are just extremely strong where as others like spider man become a meme pick. Certain ults are just unavoidable instant deaths. Everything feels like it's designed in isolation & the game just doesn't come together as a cohesive whole. You don't feel like you want to keep playing after the novelty wears off.
- The hard synergy mechanic makes the picking problem hero shooters have worse. Team fortress 2 works so well because all the counters are soft counters. Likewise with all the synergies. Overwatch is terrible because all the counters are hard counters which either force you to play something you don't want to or play anything but the thing you want to play. Hard pick synergies adds another layer of this.
- The game is confusing. Like even more than overwatch confusing. The abilities are even more insane & when you add the gimmicky enviornment destruction that was clearly just epic trying to make devs shoehorn chaos destruction into their games it's unreadable at times.

The game is fun, though for some reason, it runs poorly in my PC who is in no way a low-budget, poor quality one. I like playing matches but it's awful when I get a "running out of graphic card memory" every now and then.

Lots of good things to say, but some negatives too.

First the positives: 

Love the way battle passes are implemented. It's great that they went the non-FOMO route like Helldivers 2, where you have as much time as you need to finish the pass. Plus it's not that expensive by today's standards.

Great character skins and animations. The animations look great and there's a lot of flair/style. Good roster and there's clearly more to come.

Gameplay is fun and snappy. Time to kill seems faster than Overwatch.

For the negatives, my main complaint is the way you progress the battle pass. For some reason the devs have opted for a Daily Mission and Challenge-based system to reward progression. This is terrible for 3 reasons. 

1. Once you finish them, there's no more rewards and you are no longer incentivized to keep playing the game.

2. They are all character specific, and thus make you play as those heroes to get the XP. This makes it hard to play who you want/need to play.

3. Because there are challenges to do things like TAKE damage, people are incentivized to throw matches, leading to an all-over bad experience.

I really hope the devs take a page from Fortnite (who did away with milestone progression a long time ago) and just let people earn progress by playing the game, doing well, and winning games.

In closing, I recommend the game and hope to see it grow and improve over time. Also please give Jeff and 2099 skin.

I don't know guys.... 
Pros:
- Production value
- Character models / some abilities are cool
- Ability to swap characters mid game
Cons:
- Game play has no real weight. it's like your face is numb while you smash it into the keyboard. spamming your abilities is a viable option.
- All characters feel the same.
- No game-play feed back. The game doesn't talk to you like you would expect. play it, you'll see what i mean. when you have low health or use an ability it's really not much different then running around looking like a cool super hero idiot. The combat doesn't feel like combat.... it feels like your running around throwing rocks.
- Balancing issues. like this review. Especially with melee characters you go down fast.... like that one time you took a full Dramamine as a sleep aid. I mean you face plant hard on the concrete...your teeth are all jank your crying for help...then your re-spawn 5 american miles away from your team. 
-  No tension. Because of the lack of weight and feedback, the game plays almost the same in every situation.
- Aiming. somethings off, could be the hit boxes. Could be me......could be you.

Honestly, it does some things well and looks like its headed in the right direction.... Plus, it's a free game, so it doesn't hurt to try it. regardless of some of the issues, it can be fun if your winning...ha-ha but honestly, that's the only reason it was fun for the hour i played it. I'm no professional game reviewer, but I am a super hero to my dog, which makes me a professional super hero. for that reason, I say download it and play it.....so you can haphazardly write a review trying to put your finger on why this game feels.......feels.........off.

Wow one of the best games I’ve played this year. everything is incredible. I highly recommend everyone give this a try you wont regret it. I honestly wish I had more time to play this all day. Also RIP Stan Lee. Your legacy lives on and we will never forget you.

I see this being a very promising game! As of right now, the game is very familiar to other hero shooters, but presents it in a way that somehow feels a little better to play. Cross play is a breeze with little to no issues. You have an amazing selection of characters to play as, all with their own unique gimmicks, but similar mechanics so there's not too major of a learning curve. Rounds seem to move at a faster pace compared to similar games, which means you aren't really bogged down and can get right into the next round. But it is not without flaws.

To start out with, the major issue is a lot of new people picking up the game and not really understanding how game mode objectives work such as claiming a goal point or how to move it depending on the game mode. While there is a practice mode, its only really good for trying to figure out how heroes work and not really the game modes. Maybe some kind of tutorial video at the start of the game mode for lower level players that plays instead of the cinematic one for the map.

Another minor issue is with hero selection and ability summaries. While I mentioned earlier that each character has similar general mechanics, its their gimmicks that make them fun to play. To really enjoy the character, you need to learn their abilities. It would be nice to have a quick reference summary on what each ability does in hero selection instead of an entirely separate tab that requires me to read through the entire thing. It makes me feel discouraged to pick up a new hero due to the fact that I could be playing instead of reading a thesis in order to play a new character.

12/11/24 Additional minor issue is terrain clipping. Some hero's may clip/get stuck in the ground when they come into contact with a surface. Playing C/D, I ended up getting stuck in the ground after using my ultimate. Playing Cap, I ended up getting stuck in a wall after shield charging. The C/D glitch happened prior to the update. But the Cap glitch happened after. I does appear from the patch notes they are aware of the issue and attempting to fix.

My most glaring issue however is the in game crafting/currency/objectives/season pass madness. It is an absolute cluster muck of items and no clear usage for any of them. Some of it I could chalk up to perhaps a bad result of attempting to make something comprehensive and navigable... some of it seems down right scummy. Who thought it would be a good idea to make, at the very least, 4 separate currencies that are all used for different things with no explanation on how they work, how they're earned, or what they're used for? You earn "Chrono" for completing objectives, alright fair play. But you are then supposed to use that.. in a season pass... which will constantly try to convince you that you need the Luxury version, which is paid for. That is unless you manage to see the little alt tab button that explains you, in fact, don't need to purchase the luxury version and can use chrono to unlock items. Not so bad! But then, if you look a little closer, you notice that you maybe get 2 items that can be earned through the standard pass when there are 5 is chapters total... on each tier... the other 4 being locked behind the luxury pass. One of those unlocks being the other currency you can actually use to purchase cosmetic items. I totally get that a free game needs some alternative method of money generation, but players shouldn't have to pay for things they should getting rewarded with for playing. There's enough amazing content in this game, that is incredibly unnecessary and just leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. If anything, it really steers me to avoid giving money to this game because I'm not going to enable that kind of behavior.

In summary, I think with a little polish and a major overhaul to the in-game market/reward system, I see this being the next big hero shooter game. If not... well... there's plenty of marvel shovel-ware that did the same thing.

(Note: if I do see those improvements/changes, I will update this review)

I could be having fun but instead I'm stuck in an infinite loading screen when trying to start every other match I play. This is the only online multiplayer game in my 3 years with this PC where I am having this issue. I'd say I recommend the game but this has been such a frequent pain I can't possibly be the only one experiencing it. Game play is fun but for such a large company the network stability and connection issues are just inexcusable. Maybe I'll come back in a few months.

So far, this game is beating overwatch in gameplay and content, can't wait till they beat it in rule 34

good game, but bad optimization

The game is fun, but it has the same issues Overwatch did where unless you have a group of people to play with then there really isn't a point in playing. You get constantly put into groups where they don't play the objective, don't get kills and run the very first second combat starts even though you hopped in to help and it's now 2v1 or more and you can win the Fight. The matchmaking is just awful and just makes the game not fun to play when you lose 90% of the matches because you got put in a group with the special needs players.

And that's not even mentioning the super over priced cosmetic shop this game launched with and it's crappy battle pass that barely rewards players. Besides enjoying the game there is no incentive to keep playing as 99% of the rewards are behind a paywall and the ones you do get are dumb sprays and player cards that no one will ever see.

> No Role Restriction
> Five teammates all pick DPS, only me healer (Adam Warlock)
> Told teammates, maybe some tank?
> Teammate said shut the fuck up
> two minute in enemy have three tanks
> Teammates got decimated 
> Team blame me not healing fast enough

10/10 Would play support/healer to get blame again.

once the novelty wears off its less polished smite with overwatch abilities. cool if you like the character but the gameplay is shallow at best

This feels like one of those free anime 3rd person shooters from ten years ago, with floaty unfulfilling combat, only now there's an IP involved. Progress!

It's beautiful! It's fun! And this is the best pvp mix for Christmas!

Overwatch 2: Who are you?
Marvel Rivals: I’m you, but stronger. 

Blizzard copied TF2 and made an inferior version with Overwatch. Now NetEase copies Overwatch 2 and makes a superior version of that in every conceivable way, but most of all you can have super fast, bite-sized fun where you can play through 5 games in the time it takes you to finish 2 games in OW2 and it doesn't have those stupid play of the game cinematics thrown in your face. It's a win-win scenario, especially for those who love to have fun and challenge and go all ADHD in multiplayer matches--and you don't even have to tryhard this stuff because you get to seamlessly play with console players too. That's right they implemented a cross-play (and soon cross-save) feature that actually benefits the consumer (wow, imagine that) and doesn't suck at all. Wow, Blizzard really just can’t catch a break with all their games getting BTFO lately, huh? How sad, abloo bloo bloo. Well, this is a dish served cold levels of revenge. This is nah, I’d win levels of destruction. It really is OVER for them and I can’t get enough of WATCHing them get rekt TOO. Muhauhahauhauha.

[h1][b][i]Overwatch... Who?[/i][/b][/h1]

[i]I found my main after all these years.. Finally a top notch Marvel's Game done by somebody other than [b]insomniac games[/b]! The hype was worth it & exceeded every expectation... As of writing this review I'm oozing with joy >_< Being a superhero fan paid off! A Quality Content for Marvel Comic Lovers, Nonetheless :)

Oh btw.. don't make the mistake I did... make some space on your SSD for this game otherwise your HDD will choke like mine did.. :p[/i]

this game is bad
Overwatch 2 is better

(in terms of r34)

why would you have a competitive mode and host tournaments with so many crashes?

Really hope this game lives and not just be a fling before we go back to our love/hate relationship with OW2, etc.

Unbalanced chaos, It's fun chaos though, that's about sums it up, but the game has potential 

Cons
A. The game is currently not optimized
B. Super Unbalanced
C. No mic indication, IDK whether my mic is working or not in-game???
D. anOther Overwatch Copy, well well 

Pros
A. Matches are just one click away and fast as hell
B. It's fun at it's core
C. Cross Platform
D. Graphics and Presentation [strike]is[/strike] are Amazing

pretty fun and the experience was smooth , no bugs or crashes yet , the only sad part is that they are forcing ppl to play with an upscaler average game made on UE5

Star-Lord is so captivating that I can’t resist his charm. His pose always makes me turn on. LMAO jk.

Ok ok wait, real review:
- Unbalanced hero & skill
- Loading screen tooks forever
- Confusing button
- No dash, I mean real dash

+ Fun & chaotic
+ Art & Music
+ 30 free heroes
+ Star-Lord

this is a better game than Overwatch because Psylocke has a skin with her entire a‎s‎s out. who cares about predatory monetization when you have a‎s‎s‎e‎s. Venom has a nice one too

Have only been playing for a bit but I can say it works really well on steam deck. 

But a little tip, use proton experimental. On default proton it will black screen at the end of matches and have a few other issues. Experimental cleared up nearly everything.

All the characters are either super buff or have big butt. For that alone, it is 8/10

great game, almost. I played the during the closed beta second or third wave and had a great time, since release playing with friends is impossible. I get disconnected almost every match before I even load into the game and then when I try to reconnect my slot has already been filled forcing me to not be able too get back to the game then it proceeds to give me a  penalty. This seems to be an issue that a decent amount of others are experiencing including friends that I am playing with so it does not seem to be an isolated bug. I have sent in a report as well as a ban appeal. I hope this gets fixed because at this rate the game is unplayable. P.S. the game says I have a low ping for the server I am connected to even when I use their network diagnostic tool.

EDIT 1: logged back on to see if I had gotten a response and my penalty to a ONE HOUR ban from being able to joining causal match making,  from an automated system. the response time for customer support is 3-72 hours so not only am I unable to play but now have to wait a possible 3 days before I even get an answer. I have submitted ban appeal in game and contacted them on discord all of which have automated responses. I have no other issues with any other online game when it comes to my connection or playing with the friends that I am trying to play this game with. I attempted to play solo and still got the same issue after playing one game.

EDIT 2: Got a response from customer support, This is the response I got. "Dear Marvel Rivals Player,
after our checking, there is no relevant punishment record of the character you tell us or the punishment has already ended. Please check the character information correct or not. If you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by tapping Settings-Help and Support-Contact us to submit your issue. Thank you for your continued support!"

That is from submitting a report from the in game customer support system. I basically got the same thing from discord support only there they suggested updating the game or reinstalling the game. This is absurd and has turned me off of this game to the point that I personally don't know if  I will continue playing or not. They fact that they have all of my information and can't see that I have "disconnected" X times or that I received a penalty is crazy and the fact that across multiple different platforms there are discussions of this same issue happening and people reporting it is crazy. I am sure with the other responses I have gotten already it is either a copy paste script or another automated message. as a multiplayer game that mimics overwatch game-play which is heavily focused on team game play I will not recommend this game until it is stable enough to play with friends.

A very pleasant surprise, I expected it to be a cheap 3rd person Overwatch clone but it's actually really good, I love the art style and the graphics of the game overall, the maps are gorgeous too and they also have destructible environments and entire buildings that can be demolished, so far it has maps like Yggsgard, combining Yggrasil with Asgard, Tokyo in the future, intergalactic Wakanda, a symbiote planet and a Hydra base, all looking great visually, as for the heroes, this is the game's biggest win, all 33 launch heroes and all future heroes will be free, so no need to unlock anything apart from cosmetics, and they do all look great, very cool visual style and it has a ton of iconic heroes and they all feel very authentic to their character, like Spiderman, Ironman, Hulk, Wolverine, Black Widow, Captain Merica, Strange and more, but also a few very cool and unique heroes like Jeff the shark, some of the abilities are very similar to abilities from games like Overwatch but some are quite new too, Strange's portals feel great, and it also has a lot of melee heroes, I really like Magik a lot with her teleports and Scarlet Witch feels like a stronger Moira, Hela is also very fun and strong and Black Widow is Widowmaker and apart from their auto attacks and abilities and ultimate, there's also this cool feature with team up abilities, where if your team has 2-3 heroes from a selected team, they get bonus passive or active abilities they can use, overall I see this game becoming quite big, it already had 400k concurrent players on steam alone 2 hours after launch so it has potential, as for game modes it's the usual OW push the payload and capture the point as well as a team deathmatch short mode and it has ranked too, hopefully they will keep updating it fast with new heroes and maps and keep the hype going, I tried all the heroes and the maps already!

Another unreal engine 5 optimisation catasthrope istg this engine is gonna be the end of this sector

Pros: beautiful art style, very f2p friendly
Cons: so much sexual anime content like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&t=43s] →this← [/url]

[h1] 💀Overwatch 2 has officially been killed💀 [/h1]

The following reasons alone make this game worth playing:

[b] 1) Marvel Rivals players can claim battle pass rewards after season end for continuous benefits.[/b]
[b] 2) Luxury Battle Pass ensures rewards availability in subsequent seasons, with initial cost of $5.[/b]
[b] 3) Game monetization focused on cosmetics, with no pay-to-win elements, offering earnable skins.[/b]

Finally it's time, to give our time to developers that actually want us to play their game instead of plotting to squeeze every penny out of our wallets!

literally impossible to play this game for me because it's frying my cpu for some unknown reason, literally no game ever did this to my cpu but it gets to 95-98c in less than 10 minutes, there is NO REASON for this to happen bro, even on the lowest settings it still happens

tried control ultimate edition with everything on ultra + ray tracing on medium and it doesn't get nearly as high, genuinely what the fuck is going on here

it’s not an overwatch “killer,” but its own separate fun game. highly recommend.

Want to win a game?
- Pick Dr. Strange
- Wait for team fight
- Place portal in the middle of the fight
- Watch every player play like shit because their game is at 15 fps now with massive lag and stutters
- Throw AoEs
- Profit

Game is actually good but performance is atrocious

To preface, I have almost 40 hours in this games launch but also, another 40 from the beta. This game has a ton of good with only a little bit of bad. Lets start with the good, This game is extremely fun and the IP really lends itself to this form of game. All of the characters feel extremely powerful regardless of their role. Even as a healer you feel like a super hero. The maps are really really well done. There is a quality over quantity aspect here as the game only launched with 8 normal maps and 1 arcade mode map but, the maps we do have are of really high quality. The visuals are really enjoyable in my opinion. Some of the character designs have been points of contention in the community. However, I really enjoy most of them and love seeing new versions of old heroes. The game is very active and I rarely wait even 1 second for a match after hitting the button. Now for the not so good parts, I love that they didn't opt for role queue but, I wish they would've released more vanguards and strategists. The freedom of not being forced to have 2 of each role is a great feeling but, often times people will just autolock duelists regardless of their team composition. This makes the game (especially in ranked,) less fun overall. You can choose strategist yourself and will still end up with 5 duelists which makes solo queue in ranked a near nightmare. The worst problem by far though is the GPU crashes. After about 5-6 matches in a row my game always crashes with a GPU crash this happens to me and pretty much all of my friends. I run a 3080 with a ryzen 5800x3d so I know my system is beefy enough. This seems to be a game issue as I run all other games flawlessly. Overall, I would rate the game 8.5 out of 10. The game is tons of fun aside from a few weird balance choices and one GLARING performance issue.

Focuses on giving the player more opportunities for fun rather than punishing the player for not hard playing a certain role, which makes this game so much more fun in comparison to other hero shooters

Fun game with good potential but badly optimized. game runs bad on high graphics and swapping to rock bottom graphics gives about 4 extra frames to work with. oddly my player character seems pretty smooth but every other character moves choppily. i dont know how that is even possible but its interesting.

Hoping it doesn't go through the same fate as Overwatch, where the people who make Overwatch porn work harder than the people who make Overwatch. Fingers crossed.

hero shooter slop but marvel

still better than overwatch 2

Something new ..fresh and beautiful with Marvel characters i do love they added even some that aren't so famous ..they put them in the light ... the gameplay is fun a bit lame as some of these characters had or have their own games where they moved way more better ..but even so the game is a great adition to marvel lovers also what i love they created original designs of the characters !

it doesn’t recapture the magic Overwatch used to have, but it’s miles ahead of what Overwatch has become.

horrid optimization runs like ass on high end setup, barely 120fps on a competitive game with dlss on
unreal engine is killing games.

First ever coompetitive game that I actually enjoy, despite the soy source material

also Penis parker is cute and funny

     I have to be completely honest and say that this game feels like one of the most brilliant games released recently. (in the theme of multiplayer games and at the same time that combines the competitive with the fun and nostalgia brought by the game modes it offers - similar to other games where the creators have become desperate for money due to the success of the game and work more on trades and cosmetics thrown away just because there are collectors even if the cosmetics have a poor quality than what their game should convey; I don't want to give names of games that ended up like that)

     Due to the fact that the characters have the unique abilities offered by Marvel in their comics and all the characters are oriented to be very good in their own way, the creators managed to create a fairly good balance of the game since the launch + the idea of ​​offering the players all the characters and not having to work to have your favorite character to play with makes the game an even bigger success and much more loved by people!

     For me, the game also represents quite a lot of nostalgia, being a big fan of the Marvel series, both movies and comics, and I like to see the work done for each individual character and the interactions between them.

     In the end, I would like to say that the game is brilliant, it is worth trying for anyone who is looking for a new game that is both competitive and fun to spend time with friends or alone, and I hope that the developers of the game will continue to do a good job and make everything possible to keep the game at the high level they brought with the launch of the game!



no role queue. no passive bp xp, bad audio design (can't hear flying champs/think of echo or pharah not having sound queues when in air), one-shots

poor optimization, even with a very high-end setup. can't recommend until this is sorted out.

Yea the devs are smoking something for removing THE ONLY OPTION TO PLAY THE GAME ( With engine.ini ) THAT BOOSTS THE FPS IN A MASSIVE DEGREE WHILE NOT GIVING ANY ALTERNATIVES ( Like updating the game or optimizing ). 

I dont even get the reason why not letting us modify the graphics of the game without not even giving the players a way to play it in a good performance. Dogshit decision but amazing game sadly..

awful game anyone who plays this hasn't invested in personal hygiene since the Jurassic period

Marvel Rivals is definitely worth a try if you're searching for a fast-paced, super hero-themed game with big stakes.

Whether you're big on Marvel or a veteran of the genre, Rivals welcomes players of all skill levels.

A better Overwatch 2, even though that doesn't say much cuz the bar for being better is so low that it lays in hell.

AI matches in quickplay suck
No role queue in quickplay suck
Groot walls getting killed by allies accidentially or on purpose 9 out of 10 times
Rushing spawn after defending objective just to loose the game
Thor ult

I shouldn't be praising this, but Netease guys basically copied Overwatch’s code and imported every feature, abilities, characters, modes and pretty much everything—and then redistributed and fused them with slight adjustments to fit the MCU.

There's Starlord Tracer, a female Genji, Doomfist, Hanzo-Eye, The Punisher76, McCree, a thick female Junkrat and an actual DPS Moira (where she belongs). 
Sure, these characters were originally created in a 1964 comic or whatever, but it’s still funny.

And the best part is, it actually works better than Overwatch. The matches are fast-paced, healers can cure cancer (so they can keep teammates alive way longer), and the third-person view makes it more laid-back.

Anyway, the game prioritizes micro-transactions if you want anything. All you get to customize your profile is junk, and even that costs. But since it’s free-to-play, it doesn’t bother me too much.

The UI is horrible.

Performance could also be improved. I’ve encountered multiple issues, like characters suddenly freezing mid-game and frame drops that only a restart can fix.

And a personal downside is that you find matches in 0.3 seconds, so there’s no time to watch a 20-minute YouTube video between matches—the way you could in Overwatch.

Regardless, give it a shot with your friends, it fun.

I really thought I didn't like the Overwatch formula. Turns out I just don't like Overwatch. 
This is the most fun I've had with an online game in so long!

Bro, Marvel Rivals is wild. Playing as Venom? Absolutely insane—he’s the best, hands down. The gameplay is chaotic and fun, with crazy team combos and destructible maps. Some matches feel unbalanced, but who cares when you’re wrecking as Venom? You’ve gotta try it.

Played since the Closed Alpha and can confidently say, it slaps as hard as I would imaging Stan Lee's chiseled, wrinkled hand would.

This game is like brawl stars except every character is piper

so much fun game specially with friends..the only problem in comparison to overwatch was that this game maps and characters are too compressed like there can be so much open space and big pov but they decided to make it small so its a little frustrating to play on a smalll screen like laptop (currently playing on). Otherwise fabulous game also

they can make the prices for skin and bp a little less

Very fun game. I love majority of the hero designs, maps are really beautiful and presentation is very good and very premium for a F2P game. Overall very, very good day one experience.
Areas that need to be improved are progression and performance/optimization. Progression is basically non-existent outside of the Battle Pass that is tied to daily/weekly challenges only and performance needs to be better on PC.

One of the best games ive played with my friends.  that being said, this is one of the most infuriating game to play with all random people, it seems that the objectives are not clear to people and there is no push to enforce the objective to the ones that just run off and refuse to work as a team.    Unless I have 2 or more friends playing with me I find this game to be one of the most frustrating games to heal or tank in.

So far so good, really is a good game the Overwatch crusher.

This game changed my life for the better. Due to this game I have found a loving relationship, daily motivation, a healthy sleep schedule and a workout routine that has got me shredded. I jelq twice a day to improve mental fitness and have switched my unhealthy drinking problem out with anabolic steroids and bath salts. Thank you for affecting my life in such a significant way.

The game is really good and really fun to play, honestly a lot more enjoyable then Overwatch. I do have to uninstall the game for now though because the performance is pretty ass. Even with a RTX 4060 and a i5 11400F, the game crashes randomly saying that I don't have enough Video Ram and it causes the PC to crash at random, making the CPU max out. The game is just really poorly optimised and that really needs to be fixed.
If you've got a really sturdy/strong PC, I would recommend playing this, it's still a ton of fun

Game is actually so bad, poorly optimized and ranked is nearly impossible to play, most characters are broken and do so much damage that cant be outhealed by two healers, constant lag and the game only runs well on consoles, just fix the damn optimization please I love this game so much and I dont wanna see it die.

game crashes A LOT. i try to relaunch and rejoin my game and my spots been filled so i get punished. makes a lot of sense. fix your game its great aside from the crashing and punishment system

They removed the ability to use a performance config which ruins the game for tens of thousands of players no matter if they are casual or competitive. It was the only way for some to reach 60fps and enjoy the game with their friends on rigs that aren't even that weak, without it those players cannot even reach 30fps in team fights. That config also removed the terrible mouse acceleration/smoothing that was plaguing the game and making it feel terrible to play at higher elo brackets. At least let us turn off mouse accel/smoothing and the terrible blurry depth of field effect.

Don't get why people hype this game so much. It feels and looks like a mobile game. Looks like a lot of people are trying to like this game just because they hate Overwatch.

the game itself is cool but dear fucking god the balancing is on another level of horid. hawkeye can oneshot headshot pretty much anyone, and he has unlimited ammo and fires 2 arrows a second. luna snows ult makes her team unkillabkle, and jeff main, dont even get me started on the jeff mains. dear god.

The game is so fun. As I was tired of being shot in CS2 and R6, It revived my spirit and made me feel energetic again :D

Have a lot of fun simply joking around with friends and playing matches

Poor optimization and major imbalance between a good chunk of the cast. It's pretty much a remixed Overwatch and comes with many of the same problems.

At the moment kind of a dog shit game when it comes to balance. There's a hitscan, infinite range, no reload, area denial ult that can't be countered by killing her character called Hela. 

Tanks are boring and can't really tank or make any kind of interesting plays with their weak abilities.  You're either running around trying to avoid hits or you're pennyparker just spamming landmines everywhere for passive kills and damage.

Storm, an omega mutant, is relegated to floating around slowly, can't do headshot damage, her boost auras are short range and don't do a significant amount of damage.

Iron Fist can fly around and chase Iron Man while he's boosting. 

Hawkeye's arrows are very forgiving with headshots, his deflect melee is a useless gimmick. 

Wolverine is very slow and doesn't really regenerate except for some shield hp once every 2 minutes where he gets temp HP that doesn't amount to much if already being focused.

The Hulk has a garbage jump mechanic which is trying to copy Winston from Overwatch, except it's designed like it's for a mobile game. His ult is worthless and doesn't offer much since if he's focused he just dies and is too slow to catch up to anyone.

Magneto has very short shields and can only choose to shield himself or an ally. His frontal shield doesn't last long enough to be useful. His ult is destroyed and avoided easily versus other characters that can one shot an entire team.

Most of the hype is just that it's Marvel. Overwatch 2 more balanced than this game.

Great Overwatch killer, only issue is that it has terrible optimization, can hardly play it on PC

Never thought this game was going to get me hooked.

Even if you're not a fan of Marvel (like me), this game captures the spirit of how Overwatch felt at release really well. I think you'll be missing out if you don't start playing this game as we speak.

Here are some pros and cons to summarize what defines this title:

[list]
Pros:
    [*]I need to point this out right at the beginning. The game is MODDABLE even though it's a competitive live-service game. Wanna play as CJ? Wanna mod out all those video files? Want to have skibidi toilet playing when luna snow ults? Go for it
    [*]Every single role feels good (and most importantly fun!) to play
    [*]In over 40 hours, I haven't encountered any meaningful bugs
    [*]The progression system is engaging and fun; there's progression for your account XP, missions to gain progress for the current battle pass, and missions to level up your hero. At max hero level, you get a unique portrait for the UI and scoreboard, which is very nice
    [*]The map has a lot of destructible walls/objects that I find very unique. The enemy team sitting behind the choke point? Just destroy the wall next to them
    [*]As of now, they try to put effort into the skins they release. They fit the characters well and often have some lore background behind them
    [*]Reporting does something. Someone's throwing? Report them and they face a penalty
[/list]
[list]
The neutral things:
    [*]There's no role queue. While I like having no forced 2-2-2, other people probably wouldn't like this
[/list]
[list]
The not so fun things:
    [*]The current battle pass, just like in Overwatch 2, is not worth grinding for unless you play a certain hero that has a skin in it. Though they have premium currency in it right from the beginning
    [*]Some Heroes are unfun to play against. There's the Hanzo clone that has a seasonal damage bonus of 15% (I think?), some heroes have ults with little to no outplay (Star-Lord for example, imagine a Soldier 76 ulting you but he's in the sky, or Dr. Strange's ult that is a long AOE stun)
    [*]The performance is BAD. I am forced to play with a potato config (while playing on an RTX 3080) just so I can keep my monitor's refresh rate as fps in fights. For a competitive game, the performance should definitely be better
    [*]Some servers appear to be laggy? I have no way of proving this however
    [*]Banning heroes is a thing but only when you reach Diamond (which is currently 1.5% of the player base in Europe) so until Plat you get to enjoy playing vs Hawkeye abusers
[/list]

Its a banger.
however rn its still pretty buggy with disconnection and then penalty for being disconnected, still good and bugs are expected for this many people playing along with a new game it just needs a bit of time for patching but still earns a positive review

The best hero shooter released since Monday Night Combat (or TF2 if you want to include that). There is pretty much a character for everyone in this game without relying on pandering to the stinky manchildren who want to play low effort "I win" playstyles. This game is great to play with friends of all skill levels due to it's focus on engaging kits over simply letting players trade kills. I love that this game is focused on creating a fun sandbox through a wide array of character interactions while also showing restraint in the power levels. There are no 500% EHP Overwatch characters rolling around the map, no brainless shotgun rushing trades, and no ridiculously strong aim assist options. It's not pretending to be anything it's not. It is a "fun first" game with good gameplay, interesting character designs, and complimentary story elements that actually feel like they belong.

Dont get me wrong this game is a lot of fun and I have been enjoying it, but the preformace issues just ruin it for me, i am running the game on 1280x720 resolution with everything on low and still dropping to 30 frames a second. It wouldn't be as bad if the game had breathtaking graphics but it doesn't. Plus the developers made it so you can't edit configs which many people were doing to get some decent frame rate. There should be no reason why the game is as poorly optimized as it is. It is such a shame this is seen as standard and I hope the devs address it in some way because I really do enjoy playing this game, espessialy with friends.

[h1]Marvel Rivals - A Refreshing Take On The Genre [/h1] 

Fixing balances by making everything imbalanced is a power play and a smart move. This seemingly contradictory statement perfectly captures the dynamic gameplay of Marvel Rivals. It's a game that embraces asymmetry, creating exciting and unpredictable matches.

 [h2]What is Marvel Rivals?[/h2] 

Marvel Rivals features a roster of iconic (and some more obscure) Marvel characters. You'll team up with other players, utilizing unique abilities and strategies to achieve victory across various game modes. 

[h2]Key Features:[/h2] 

*   [b]Diverse Roster:[/b] Play as a wide range of Marvel heroes and villains, each with their own distinct playstyles. From web-slinging Spider-Man to the powerful Hulk, there's a character for everyone. 
*   [b]Asymmetrical Balance:[/b] This is where Marvel Rivals truly shines. Instead of striving for perfect character balance, the game embraces imbalances, creating exciting matchups and strategic depth. This "power play" leads to dynamic gameplay where mastering character strengths and exploiting weaknesses is key. 
*   [b]Easy to Pick Up, Rewarding to Master:[/b] The core gameplay is intuitive and easy to grasp, making it accessible to newcomers. However, the strategic depth and intricacies of each character's abilities provide a high skill ceiling for those looking to master the game.
*   [b]Fast-Paced 6v6 Action:[/b] Engage in thrilling team-based battles, utilizing teamwork and coordination to outmaneuver your opponents. 

[h2]My Experience:[/h2] 

I found the game consistently fun and engaging. The variety of characters, the fast-paced action, and the unique approach to balance kept me coming back for more.

 [h2]Pros:[/h2] 

*   Fun and engaging gameplay 
*   Diverse and recognizable cast of characters 
*   Unique approach to balance creates strategic depth 
*   Easy to learn, hard to master 

[h2]Cons:[/h2] 

*   Balancing may be an issue down the line. 
*   Everyone wants to play Duelist, so role queue may be something the devs want to look into. 

[h2]Overall:[/h2] 

Marvel Rivals is promising and offers a fresh take on the genre. Its focus on asymmetrical balance and diverse character abilities creates a dynamic and exciting gameplay experience. If you're a fan of the genre or Marvel comics, this is definitely a game to keep an eye on. 

[h2]Would I recommend it?[/h2] 

One hundred percent if you're into the genre. It's refreshing and although not quite original, IS original in its own way.

Love getting a warning from a game that I'm going to be banned for disconnecting when the game is crashing my entire computer. It's not just me, every one I've talked too has crashed out of this game and devs are sitting on their hands doing nothing.

A shitty game filled up with shitty community of losers with no life and future trying to catch streamers like those streamers give a fuck that they will stream snipe them while they earn money from such idiots who do so.

Very poorly optimised. Fps gotten worse since the winter patch and dev chose to disable FPS Config to add cherry on top 

Good job dev!!!!!!!!

The whole fortnite skin monetization stuff sucks really bad but modern gamers are meant to be brutalized so whatever, but all the dialogue is like it was written making fun of  the super hero genre. You'll be kicking someones ass and then the spider-man in your game will just say "Oh geeze man, I hope my girl forgives me after this one!" or "Erm yeah, that just happened!". That being said the game is free and fun. 

One thing to note though is everyone praises this game for not shying away from having sexy characters/skins, but what they really mean is the characters aren't intentionally ugly because some neurotic character designer, unfortunately since that is the norm now, any deviation of that gets praised, but 2016 overwatch put every woman in a skin tight body suit and gave them the triple BBL dumpcake and this game isn't anywhere near that level, the characters just aren't ugly like modern overwatch.

I like playing the game, but the optimisation is horrible.
One moment you're playing all fine the next your game freezes and you become a burden to your team.
For the love of God please fix it...

As a moira player, I thank you for putting 2 characters in the game where I can be the highest rank whilst drooling on my keyboard.

I know the game is new, but the balancing is worse than every other hero shooter I've played.  Some characters are just downright broken, and some feel like they serve no purpose.  Next is the matchmaking.  The first few matches were pretty fun, it was mostly even win or lose.  Recently I played with my friends for about 10 matches or so.  We won like 3.  We got stomped majority of the games, even switching to mains didn't help.  We're all pretty similar in experience and skill, so it's not like I'm queueing with people out of my league.  We were 4 stacking, so we had 2 randoms with us.  Almost every time without fail, both picked dps (duelist class) and were terrible.  At one point i had more damage as rocket (a support character) than our scarlet witch (a mindless damage character.)  This happened for multiple games, and people might call it a skill issue on our part, sure.  Then match us with people at our skill level.  One win does not warrant getting steamrolled three times afterwards.  Once again, I know the game is new, and I don't expect it to be perfect.  So, when they fix these problems, I will change my review.

>players fix their FPS/Mouse Acceleration issue by editing a config file
>devs remove said file saying they don't want their game files fiddled with
And then they proceed to say that Mouse Acceleration will be added in season 1??? You're expecting us to wait until January for such a simple change which is much needed?
Its been about 2 weeks and still no balance patch, instead we get a new gamemode no one asked for and skins.
Can't recommend the game in this state, very unbalanced.

Understands what made Overwatch fun and has no shame replicating it 1:1.

Gameplay is fine. Optimization is terrible. 
A 3060 at 1440p and the lowest graphics settings possible (FSR off due to stuttering) only manages around 70-90 fps during team fights which is unplayable for a competitive FPS game. With the community's help, that fps was boosted closer to 200 fps during team fights and was very pleasant. Unfortunately the developer has gone out of their way to disable those performance optimizations enabled by the community. Limiting your audience to only those who have the best gpus on the market is not a great strategy. Removing the ability to turn off mouse acceleration is another inconvenience to anyone attempting to play the game competitively. 

I had fun for the first few days but attempting to play it today was just miserable. Would not recommend.

If you were a fan of the OG-Overwatch this game is for you. 

This game brings forth the Classic style of Overwatch along with its own unique mechanics, you get the best, if both worlds. I believe this is what Overwatch 2 should have became, unique team ups, sticking to the core play-style of this kind of multiplayer experience and not trying to just be a money grab and social pleaser to everybody that found out about the game. 
This game so far, as of the writing of this review holds more care towards the world it's designed from and the community that plays it that we naturally want to give them money to keep enjoying a game that was built to be fun, immersive and overall enjoyable. 

I grew up LOVING Overwatch, it still holds a place in my heart. But I know those days are over and the one thing I am grateful to have replace my memories with and give me a bright horizon for new memories is Marvel Rivals. It's nice to have developers care for the community that the game was built for.

BTW, I grew up with Marvel. Books and Shows alike but I barely remember any if it yet this game still makes me love the characters and the world, let alone the mechanics and game style.

If you're iffy about the game, give it a shot. It won't hurt to find out about the game from user experience instead of a review. ;D

my very expensive gamer pc from temu cant even handle this fuck of a game. i payed a witch from Etsy 12,99 dollars to hex this fucking game full of homeless looking characters. im starting onlyfans to buy a new computer so i can log in one last time and say slurs in the voice chat before smashing my head against my fucking wall as long as it takes to forget this game ever existed.

Marvel Rivals brings back the nostalgic feel of the games I grew up with, but with a fresh and modern twist. The game is incredibly well-designed, packed with countless ideas and details inspired by Marvel’s comic books, making it a true homage to the iconic universe. Unlike another games, Marvel Rivals offers a deeper and more immersive experience, capturing the essence of classic heroes and stories. It’s everything another games could never be: a thoughtful, heartfelt game that combines engaging gameplay with a rich, captivating world and with heroes that I really care about.

Its Overwatch minus the ripping off their fans. Also shout out to the girls and the gays for carrying with the support roles.

Honestly great, I know everyone compares this to overwatch. But for me this is a seriously impeccable replacement. I’ve not even thought about playing overwatch since this came out, and I don’t even plan on going back. Just hope the devs don’t make the same mistakes by catering too much to the competitive community over genuine fun.

solid meh! i gave it a good College Try but i'd rather just play overwatch sorry. marvel is not strong enough to carry this game for me just my preference good day gamers

After spending enough time on this game, I can tell that this game is a polished turd. 

The balance issues are irrelevant because balancing will happen all throughout a game's entire life, but just the way the game plays and feels is very amateur. 

The gameplay feels like a bad 2010 action game a lot of these heroes' abilities don't really make any sense. It feels like the developers were forced to pick a few of the most popular characters and fit them in somehow. Loki, for example, being a healer but also has a backstab? This is a wasted opportunity to create an assassin out of him, but there's already too many DPS and they just made him a healer with a really bad kit that doesn't suit who he is. There's more heroes I can go on about, but it's best you play the game yourself to see how poorly designed some of these heroes are.

When you're all done with your honeymoon phase, you'll come to terms with the fact that this game is just a polished turd carried by a powerful license. (You're just playing Paladins)

Fun game, more fun than OW so far in my opinion. The way the characters were made is very satisfying, with so many unique choices that are genuinely fun to learn and play with. Especially Spiderman, holy moly, one of my favorite characters to play in a modern (post-OW) hero shooter.

There are some issues with balancing and performance, but under the assumption that those things will be addressed in future patches, I'm rating this positive. If you like OW, you'll probably like this. If not, probably not. But there are exceptions.

worst then overwatch about balancing and map design. They have apes in balance team ppl.

back in the day my most predominant rival in elementary school was a man who insisted yugioh was superior to pokemon cards. every afternoon when i would leave my last class (painting) he would be outside and usher me over with a wave of his slender hand. i would grab my pocket to insure my monsters were in fact still safe from foul play, and only then i would follow his beckon call. the final meeting we had was an all out duel between my porygon 2 card and his yugioh deck. to this day he insists he won to the prison guards at the mississippi department of corrections despite me ripping up like half of his cards.

in the end i think what i took away from that experience was card games are for the weak minded, the little willed, and the old yet unhappy.

Most fun I've had with a Hero Shooter since Overwatch's early years. Game definitely has some room for improvement, but very promising so far, and hope it can last.

Awesome game
0 Pay to win elements 
Chaotic and fun
right now only some characters are very overpowered, I am sure they willl balance  them in the next coming weeks.
Give it a shot, nothing to lose.

Trash. Impossible to tell what is fucking happening ever. UI and environments are cluttered and unclear. Damage an enemy to 1hp 3 times and they instantly get their full health bar back every time. It just doesn't make any sense. Every match is like playing with bots.

I'm not sure what there is to object to with a free to play offering with no pay to win and only unobtrusive costume offerings for actual money. The graphics are good, the dialogue is cute, and you run around and wail on other people a bunch. Do I understand the nuances of anything going on? Absolutely not. Do I care? Not really.

This game is great and I would definitely recommend it if it wasn't trying to intentionally screw me over. I have rarely played a match where something hasn't gone wrong. The game randomly stutters, freeze, or outright crash multiple times in the same match. It is especially annoying when someone plays Doctor Strange and tanks my fps from 100 down to 20 by spawning a portal in. Even with a 4070Ti and 5900X, having the game installed on an SSD separate from the OS, and even playing on low settings, the game will still find a way to stutter or freeze. Computer specs are definitely not the issue as hundreds of others with similar or better specs than me experience the same issue on PC.

It is a massive shame as I really wanted to enjoy this game with friends but the poor optimisation makes it hard for me to come back to this game just to get screwed over almost every match. It's just not worth it until they fix these issues at some point.

GET RID OF THE FORCED BOT MATCHES IN QUICK MATCHES!!!!! Notice how if you lose 2 or so games you find yourself stomping the next game? Yea those are bots. Just check their profiles (they will all be "private") or spectate any deaths you have. It's an insult to our time as players and if you leave one you get penalized. ******* stupid. REMOVE THEM!

Change this and its a thumbs up. Fun game but this is incredibly dumb.

I would recommend it if there wasn't such a huge issue of the poor performance/memory leaks and getting penalized for it. Never had issues with it until recently but now its borderline unplayable since I crash before the round even starts.

It's... okay.

I'm giving it a thumbs up, but it has a lot of issues that I hope are improved down the line.

For example, movement in this game has to be one of its worst qualities. There's just no inertia to it and it feels very on rails as a result. This to me is its biggest downside, as someone who really enjoys how it feels to move around in games like Deadlock or Overwatch 2. 

Having said that, everything else is okay. The maps are good, the hero selection is good, and every character I've played so far is fun to learn. It has all the great hallmarks of what it could be in the future, as long as dev support keeps up.

If they can improve movement, I can see myself playing this more. Until then, It's still a good recommendation for a hero shooter to play w/ friends, but I consider Overwatch 2 and Deadlock superior games at this time.

Incredibly Mid, game of the month overwatch clone

**UPDATE STEAM ASKED ME TO REDO THIS REVIEW ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ITS STILL MID** 

Haven't had this much fun since OG Overwatch dropped and I consider Rivals to be even better than that, having a blast to say the least and the fact that its made up of Marvel characeters I know and love, its perfect for what it is, highly recommend.

TL;DR If you're a tank main, you will (probably) not enjoy this game. Unless you're one of those people who seem to enjoy every game no matter how shit you do. In which case, I envy you. 

I truly do not understand why people who have played Overwatch, TF2 and similar hero shooters enjoy this game more somehow. Maybe it's just new game syndrome. 
To start, yes I am bad at this game. I'll gladly admit that. But the game isn't at all making me want to play to get better at it either. 
I saw someone say recently that whoever makes a hero shooter where tanks are fun to play will be literal trillionaires, and I couldn't agree more. As a tank player I am so tired of just being completely useless in every game and just standing by watching DPS players deal 2 million damage per second and be hyper mobile and even in some cases MORE TANKY than the actual tanks. When I saw how mobile the tanks in this game were it actually ignited a tiny spark of hope in me. Maybe for once as a tank I would be able to keep up with the DPS and not be kited into oblivion all game long. But no, that was not the case. 
Yes, tanks in this game might have mobility, but you can bet your ass most of the DPS will always have more mobility than you. If I hammer dash in as Thor but slightly miss the DPS, they will just dash away and I will always be slightly too far away to even hit them at all, because I have the attack range of fucking toddler. But if I want to get out of that situation I have to instantly realize I will never reach them, in order for me to dash out to (relative) safety in time. If I stay for a second too long I will get instantly oneshot because my 200 overshield doesn't do shit. 
In this game tanks have neither the luxury of dealing damage or being tanky, so it just feels like you are literally a slightly bigger DPS with none of the damage, and you simply exist to soak damage for the team for roughly one second, so that your Hawkeye or Hela has time to oneshot the enemy backline. 

I also think playing healer is a miserable experience, but they also get to deal a surprising amount of damage while healing for 60 million HP/S. 

Yes, I am obviously salty because I for some reason choose to be a tank main despite years of abuse, but I'm starting to think that maybe we should just remove the tank role completely from the hero shooter genre, because no one seems to enjoy playing it (look to Overwatch 1 where we had insane queue times because no one wanted to play the role) and they just generally seem to be a balancing nightmare, so what's the point really?

Whole game is a rip-off Overwatch.  Yes, it has (for now) much better care, lvoe and support, but still it is a dull rip-off, unbalanced.

If you wanna pressure Blizzard for making OW again the best one out there, play here, Otherwise don't bother.

really enjoying the game! I dunno if that will remain the same after the honeymoon phase is over but it's been a blast till now!

every menu makes noise and has animations, it is a stimulation nightmare and hopefully they will add a way to turn that stuff off

I only play this game for Jeff

While the game is definitely (barely) better than Overwatch 2, its hard to say that the ideas behind some of the characters are "good". Iron Fist is a good example, being able to reach fliers that are miles above them and stay up there shouldn't be so easy. As well as being very quick, even for a small, melee-based character.
There are other examples like Jeff's ultimate ability being very overpowered when barely used properly, cough cough jumping off the edge with 5 people on the team, but those sometimes are manageable... because you get a warning for Jeff's ultimate, not for Iron Fist launching himself toward you.
If you get one or two faulty teammates that aren't able to perform as well as the others, it can screw up the entire game for you, especially if it's your healers. Not to say it'll always end in a loss, but it will almost always be tougher. 
Yes I am upset about Iron Fist, yes I have died too many times to him, yes I get salty when a melee character is able to practically fly. Iron Fist feels like one of the many problems with the characters in the game.

The currency is also a problem, but I don't bother buying much anyways.

This game as a whole is very good, design, gameplay (sometimes), and etc. But one thing i LOATHE about this game is the performence issues, I heard using unreal engine is not good for games solely on the reason of tanking the performence. Thats all

It's fun and it has Squirrel Girl. They desperately need to work on optimization though because as it stands this game is all over the place in terms of performance. I'm about in the middle of their specs and I have no clue how anyone near minimum will play this at an acceptable framerate. I'd expect their computer to just implode when Strange opens a portal.

Horrible optimization they also patched the engine and config files so you can make fps urself (why the fk would you do that?xd)

Yes, it's Like overwatch...but more fun.  A lot of people that didn't like Overwatch enjoy Marvel Rivals simply because of the characters. If you're a superhero/marvel fan. Pick it up! Be warned it's not easy but it's satisfying to get to control your favorite MC character. Also not all characters are difficult but Spider-Man can be a tough one...just fyi

Absolute banger of a game, reminds me of old days of overwatch which was really fun but this tops it easily

Game is pretty fun.
I always die to Hawkeye and I have begun to froth and foam with rage at the sight of that arrow-firing freak.

RIP Overwatch. This game took all of the lessons of it's failure and corrected them.

9/10 Great Game. However, that stupid ass shark dog needs to be put down.

brand new account just wanted to see how the game was and the first game i was put in with a bunch of level 80 accounts, i lasted four games before deleting it, terrible game would not suggest playing unless your literally brain dead. Takes zero skill if you want you can just mash buttons with a overpowered character and be top of the leader board. game is meant for literal children

It's Overwatch, but actually fun~
Also any Marvel game with Punisher as a starting roster addition is great~

Great game! 
Basically improved OW with all the features you would have wanted at the release of OW.

I don't see any optimization problems but my rig is pretty good, 
playing on 2K with everything maxed out and on native resolution.

Overwatch 3 turns out to be quite the upgrade to Overwatch 2.

Sorry Blizzard, you lost.

I Can't begin to understand why they made scarlet witch so damn op and no skill to use. RIP my keyboard and table

I don't usually play this type of game but it's got me hooked. Really fun characters, great matches and loads of potential going forward.

I enjoy this game a lot. Unrelated, but I am a Clock and Dagger main. Lord status. This game has good mechanics, good graphics, can get a lot of stuff for free, can get most of the battle pass for free, and there is a character for every playstyle so everyone can enjoy it. There is crossplay, so you can play with anyone; it's not limited to any platform. I enjoy playing it with my friends. I've gotten around 10 people to download the game now. Happy that it's a free-to-play game. Pretty much like Overwatch but better, the better version. I am happy my boyfriend told me about this game; otherwise, I would have never played it. If you're a Marvel fan, I would say download this game.

I luv this game and I'm 100% supporting the death of Overwatch.

The server issues are crazy rn tho pls fix. Teammates and friends are always getting kicked, unable to reconnect. Servers are fluctuating at really high pings. Assuming it's just cuz of the insanely high player counts for winter break, some servers are probably chugging.

Amazing game, great characters, perfect UI, sound and music design goes nuts, and all the characters are fun to play. 10/10 would recommend, even to those like me who aren't the biggest fans of 6v6 shooters

Real conversation that just happened while playing Rivals:
"This feels more like Overwatch than current Overwatch does."
"Why, because it's fun?"

Perfect
