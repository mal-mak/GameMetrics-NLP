Couldn't really get into the game but is a phenomenal multiplayer experience, while the cut scenes and game are beautiful the scenes tend to drag on and on.
I loved the voice acting and model designs, would recommend if you have people to invite.

For the EMPEROR !!!

YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!! MORE MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!! FFFFFFFOOOOORRRRRR THE EMPEROR!!!

For the emperor

Top tier 40k game.  Takes everything from original Space Marine game and improves upon it.  Multiplayer is fun, mainly coop. Haven't done PVP but hear it's mixed.

I love this game. It's the best 40K game ever released.

Game is not stable. I have a ryzen 9 7900x, the game never uses more than 20% of its resources. I have a 12g 3060 and configured the game to use around 8g of vram. I cant play longer than 5 minuets without a crash. I love the IP but without some kind of stability fix this is trash. on top of that last I checked the 3060 was the most common graphics card out there these days why is optimization so poor?

too many bugs. revisit in 2025

Awesome big suit guys

One word: BROTHERHOOD

BEST WARHAMMER GAME!
FOR THE EMPEROR!

Pros:
* Good graphics especially with the 4k texture pack
* Game play allows you to feel like a Space Marine
* Lots of customization available
* Cross-platform play (only in PvE)
* Blood everywhere
Cons:
* Needs a training area where you can practice parrying and dodging certain enemies
* Class selection menu in PvE operations don't allow you to see which classes have been already selected, you can only guess by the available classes
* PvP is a coin toss, sometimes the team you get is full of low levels, while the other team has more high levels
* Need more PvE and PvP maps
* The available cosmetics are not enough :)

the fall off of Space Marine 2 needs to be studied. not really it just has no endgame or replay value.

FOR THE EMPEROR RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

The Emperor Protects.

This game is the antidote to all the woke nonsense being put in front of game design,
all the side quest nonsense filler just added to games to justify price and
is well paced, presented and written 

Happy to pay for a 9 hour campaign of that quality



yes

yes

This is for production team. I had a problem when I played this beatifull game. I could not guard to attacks as I like, I played last god of war games, there was very nice guarding system. Yeah ofcourse I am guarding to attacks but it was not satisfied system. For example just I finished the game with Angels of Death difficult, I am not newbie for this kind of games but this guarding system must be improved. We are not Flash or Superman! you need to see some thing to press guard/block button, but enemy is attacking, then just using your instings and you are quessing with your past experience "it is gonna attack" and trying to block that attack.  And if you are surrounded by enemies there is no change to see their attack. Actually one by one also is hard to see. At this kind of games blocking is very important and giving satifaction when you blocked. I think soo many people also have same idea.

Y e s

the parry system is bad doesnt always work, sometimes u get stuck and get staggered to death, go one difficulty higher and mobs already can one shot you, even if u have almost the strongest weapon in game u still need to hit enemies 10 times with heavy attacks for en execution other then the gameplay the game design looks good, but t he controls and combat is 3/10

blood everywhere

Nice.

i love the warhammer and that was a good game i like to play it .  I recommended <3

(so far) very basic run and gun and not a lot of fun - No real desire to play any more

Mint

amazing game overall for those who like 3rd person shooting

i recommend it wanna be a real man

I will NOT suffer the Unclean to live! 

I will uphold the honor of the Emperor! 

I abhor the witch, I destroy the witch! 

I accept any challenge, no matter the odds!

ALWAYS ANGRY! ALL THE TIME!

NO PITY! NO REMORSE! NO FEAR!

Game chới rất đã tay, đặc biệt là chơi với bạn bè

A 6v6 PvP mode with three game types:
Annihilation: A team deathmatch where you earn points for your team by killing enemy marines. The first team to 50 points wins. 
Seize Ground: A domination mode where teams fight to control a moving zone on the map. The team that scores the most points wins. 
Capture & Control: A king of the hill mode where teams fight to control three zones on the map. The team that scores the most points wins. 
To access the multiplayer modes, you must first progress through the main mission and report to Captain Acheran. Once you've done that, you can go to the Thunderhawk Platform on the Battle Barge and use the console to select a game mode. 
In addition to multiplayer, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 also has a campaign mode that can be played by up to three players.

For ultramar!!!!

Absolute barn burner! 100% would recommend! Really hope they will release some additional story mode content in the future!

if you are a Warhammer 40k fan this game is a must play. it delivers on all your space marine power fantasy dreams with an amazing story line.

Got me into the series more


good game. i typed a bunch of shit out and it got deleted.

yes

very unstable although i suppose they'll eventually patch every bug out
very enterteaining game when you're able to run it lol

satisfying executions and action

holy crap im new the 40k universe as of like 2 months ago and this game is fantastic! The co-op, the story so far is fantastic, killin aliens has never been so good.

very immersive and fun

Shooting a horde of gaunts eith a multi melta might be one of the most satisfying video game moments I have ever experienced.

Xenomorph get squished

b

For big  E

I have only played through the campaign on normal at the time of this review and I will say it was a blast. The game does a great job of making you really feel like an Ultramarine. In my opinion the game is worth the asking price for my 9 hours of gameplay so far. 

I'll try to update this review with my opinion on the other modes once I get around to sinking some time into them.

Game good.

Very simple gaming mechanics. Lots of fun, game is completely packed with plenty to be entertained with, without these "micro transactions" as most games nowadays in order for you to unlock the full experience.

Great story

great co-op fun graphics are insane

pretty cool

All game studios take note. This is how its done

Immense potential.
Inept devs. Wish it was made and developed with someone like the devs of Helldivers 2.
Campaign : Amazing
PVP : Nice, not my cup of tea
Operations : Greatest idea ever. Very bad handling. Difficulties are basically 2 : "walk in the park" or "Rage quit". You don't feel like a Space Marine, you feel like a Dark Soul idiot DRESSED as a Space Marine.
Very sad, this could have been the greatest game ever.

We are the Ultramarines, the sons of Guilliman. Whilst we draw breath, we stand. Whilst we stand, we fight. Whilst we fight, we prevail. Nothing shall stay our wrath.

Game of the Year imo. fucking love it!

Its fantastic game with some absolutely huge problems in operations: god awful AI mechanics and borderline unplayable single player. Your AI teammates will NOT EVER help you, in fact they will ignore enemies and let you die just to give you the opportunity to glory kill an enemy. But you can't do that if you are DEAD, also enemies will largely ignore your teammates to attack the player, a TYRANID, beings that exist purely to consume, will literally walk past your AI teammates to attack you, and don't bet on your teammates attacking them either. It is one of the most enjoyable Warhammer games ever made IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH otherwise don't ever touch operations because difficulty locks progression and jumps from so easy its almost boring to almost unplayable. Eternal War is great and so is the campaign, balanced, dynamic and engaging. But PLEASE god make the AIs function in single player, we have had more functional AI teammates AND enemies since like 2009, they work better in Space Marine 1 for christ's sake.

gg

kill bug

they haven't touched multiplayer with an update or anything since launch?  yikes

Everything you'd want out of a WH40K game, the only thing I want is more.

Purge Heretics

One of the best WAR HAMMER 40K games made so far and the co-op is always nice to be able to game with some friends or "friendly" pugs.

Easy game to write a review for. Let's start with the score; 8.2/10. Viscera, gore, and brotherhood await, if you have the nerve. The campaign can be dialed down for _baby mode_ - but don't be so quick to think the PvP OR PvE is smooth-brain friendly. The game is written better than most Netflix movies. The main detractor, not enough online content. The single player is *chefs kiss* while for someone like me, PvE doesn't spark the same dopamine rush that PvP does. Please, more maps and improved match making types.

Great game. Good mix of co op and single player.

one of my favorite multiplayer gaming experiences of all time. personnally prefer this to this years helldivers 2. what an awesome fun experience


I adore this game..I just want more... 
Into the fires of battle.
Unto the anvil of war..

Solid game

Blood for the blood god, SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE

good

In a time where the horrors of Tzeentch spread their vile corruption throughout the gaming industry The Emperor sees fit to bless us for our devotion with the return of this series. 

The Ron Swanson of games. Shorter than ideal, but otherwise nearly perfect in its uncompromising focus on manliness, honour, and brotherhood, and coupled with the rejection of irrelevant nonsense, useless aesthetics, and any and all pandering, this is clearly one of the better recent titles.

Let us hope Cavill and co. can continue this in the amazon show. However, much like an astartes seeing a techpriest's careless treatment of a power source, I remain vigilant towards the possibility of heresy. 

Controls and combat are generally very good, visuals and audio very high quality, and story was just enough to motivate the players actions while not getting in the way of what we are here for. The sense of urgency and fighting against the odds are maintained throughout without lessening the feeling of being a genetically enhanced futuristic super-warrior. Only minor issues. Somewhat short campaign (but with extra missions for the other teams which is a fun idea), a bit weird handling on the jump packs, and sometimes weapons reset at the start of missions when you clearly had other weapons going in (for instance: in the last mission I had a hammer, then I went through a portal and suddenly had a power sword).  

8.5/10

doesnt let you play, crashes every time on first cutscene

Yeah its alright

I've only played for a few hours, but I can tell that this game will be staying near the top of "recently played". Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is a beautiful and unique combination of both gun and "sword" mechanics. It is a combination between Doom Eternal and... some other awesome game. This game makes you feel like a giant bio-enhanced human that was created for ripping and tearing. All the way from the clunk, clunk, clunking or you boots to the start up of a giant machine, this games sound designs adds to its... uh, amazingness? IDK. This game is just good. 👍 Very good!

Even with the new Update for the game and Nvidia drivers claiming to support this title, I can't get my 4060Ti to run this game anywhere past the seizure warning. Every minute I've spent on this game has simply lead to crashes and even blue screens because it's unplayable on my GPU. Might pick it back up down the line but until then I'm getting my money back.

Combat is lackluster.

For the EMPEROR !

I really enjoy this game but unfortunately it is unplayable. almost every single time i load into a game it crashes randomly and due to the lengths of those game it has wasted a significant amount of my time and i know i am not alone in this and due to that i can not recommend this game at this time. if this were free to play it wouldn't be so bad but its not and they tool my money with out providing the service i paid for.

Great product. The game is super fun and easy to get into. I am a brand new 40k fan with no experience in the game or lore, and this was a great starting point for me getting into all of it. I look forward to the black hole that I have to fall into that is 40k, after I finish up this product.

Game is insane and you truly feel like an unstoppable force as playing as a space marine!

Amazing game, should have won GOTY!

The Emperor protects.

Decent campaign.  Fun Coop

BROTHER!

s

Great action in a lore filled and wonderfully detailed environment.

its an amazing way to get a friend into Warhammer and its one of the better action shooters out there

It's fun.

very nice

too many loading screens , load into game, loaded into the hub, choose lethal , loaded into a group (ongoing run) went to the ship , loaded into the map, my character was taken, left the group, another loading screen, this repeated 4 times so i logged off and went to play hell-divers 2, solution let me host a lobby that isn't private 
*note*
the loading screens are long as f**k 
other that that this game is great lethal is unbalanced as shit but i love it 
the parry system is great sometimes 
the graphics are insane(might be root cause of loading screens duration)
classes are all really great 
gun play is alright 
exectutioners are crazy 
game is fun its just the amount of loading screens for me

Buggy graphics, buggy sound and occasional freezes make this a fairly WTF experience given the price. The worst thing was the dialog kept cutting out and going out of sync, probably the most unpolished modern game I've ever played. I mean I could play as a floating bolter with only half the story but why should I? 70/100 at best, if they fixed everything 80-85/100.

    I command in the name of the Emperor.
    While the enemies of the Emperor still draw breath, there can be no peace.
    Today the enemy shall know fear.
    The Emperor protects.
    Praise the Emperor.
    He who stands with me shall be my brother.
    Walk softly...and carry a big gun.
    Beware the alien, the mutant, the heretic.
    For the glory of the Emperor!"
    For the Emperor!
    Follow me into battle.
    My aim shall not falter!
    This day shall be a glorious one for the Imperium.


Amazing game. Only complaint. Want more campaign. Still, amazing.

hi

45Minutes of constant crashes into a refund.

Masculinity in it's purest form

Game freezes on opening cutscene still almost 4 months after release. Also freezes when I go to change graphics in game. game is not compatible with the NIVIDIA app also, which means I cant change the graphics from outside the game while its closed. It's not my PC specs, I buy a ton of new games and I currently stream STALKER 2 1440p 60 FPS with absolutely no issues. Even after the A-Life was added. Space Marine 2 can't even load a cutscene. While I did return this game out of pure frustration, I am buying it again because my friend desperately wants to play it with me. Let's hope that pausing the first cutscene and waiting for a skip prompt will allow me to finally play the game. Probably a waste of my time, whoever structured this game needs to be fired. Loading a cutscene while loading into a server was a huge mistake. 4 months later and its still an issue. I would call this a fail by the devs. 4 months? Do your job.

I don't have words for the carnage and the sheer badassery you feel when playing this game. INTENSE!

Its 40k...nuff said


One of the best 40k Games you will play along with some of the best Lore "Easter Eggs" through out... if you are in to your 40k this game is for you!

Rating: 9/10

Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish. As a third-person shooter, it delivers tight, fluid gameplay that strikes a perfect balance between chaotic melee combat and tactical shooting. Whether you’re shredding through hordes of Tyranids with a bolter or smashing them to bits with a chainsword, every moment feels impactful and satisfying.

The storytelling is another standout element. The game immerses you in the grim darkness of the 40k universe, with a compelling narrative that captures the brutal and heroic tone of the Space Marines. The voice acting and character moments add depth and tension, making it hard to put down.

Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. The environments are richly detailed, capturing the gothic, industrial aesthetic of the 40k universe perfectly. The sheer scale of battles, combined with the stunning graphics, makes you feel like a true warrior in humanity’s darkest hours.

The only thing keeping this from a perfect 10/10 is some minor repetition in enemy encounters, but honestly, the gameplay is so fun you won’t care much.

If you’re a fan of Warhammer or just love action-packed third-person shooters with incredible storytelling and graphics, this is a must-play. For the Emperor!

very good game play


Finally a new game that isn't Funded by BlackRock and it doesn't have any WOKE messages like the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and its way better too. I really do like the melee weapons, combos, new guns, and a final boss. I do like the co-op mode which is rare because I usually only play single player games but there's a catch to that.

I feel like this game is more focus on co-op than single player because when making a game that is more focus on co-op or multiplayer like Halo, you have the same game-play restrictions as the multiplayer when playing single player. I don't like the 2 weapon limit but in this game its worse because the first slot you can only carry handguns like the bolt pistols, and the second slot only lets you carry firearms like the bolt rifle, and the game doesn't let you carry 2 firearms. The evade/dodge button doesn't register properly because of its delay and same thing with the parry button. The FPS is stable on my pc for 95% of the time but the second time I get the jet packs the FPS drop to 15-20, and I had to exit the game, verify the files, and start the game again to get it working again. 

Overall I give this game a 7 out of 10, I just wish this game didn't remove some of the melee weapons like the Axe and grenade launcher, and I wish they didn't remove the 3 weapon limit like the first game.

Campaign was very buggy.  Progress was lost frequently which was very frustrating and wasted many hours.  Progress is typically lost AFTER completing an entire operation.

yup

This game is so poorly programmed I am amazed they feel justified to charge $60. 
How difficult is it to save progress? We have lost ENTIRE missions worth of progress several times, HOURS of gameplay lost because some lazy team could not save state.

Do not buy this game if you value your time. Do not support a company that cannot do enough design and code reviews to put out a product that does the bare minimum of saving your progress.

I grew a 3rd Testicle from all the Testosterone Gaines. And the Transformation Continues,,,,

good

This looks like a half-baked game. Campaign is a long tutorial and multiplayer is a boring grind for cosmetic upgrades. I had better memories of Space Marine I, but maybe I'm wrong. Can't be botherered to reinstall it. There are much better games out there worth your time. Content is minimal. Multiplayer reminds me of Quake with no improvement.

not impressed by the minuscule amount of content in this game, for 80 dollars i would expect more. it looks good, plays good and multiplayer is fun but i beat the game in 8 hours, theres 7 co-op missions i think and then its only pvp. there is nothing else... you unlock some things to customize your characters armor and its a small ribbon... or the exact same ribbon in a different spot on his shoulder, or a small skull... you can change the color, i think... how did it take them so long to make this game and there is no content in it... just another example of why baldurs gate 3 is such a good game.

The game is clunky and long windned animations killed it for me.

Great game and a great sequel to the original. A bit short for the asking price (main campaign) but you do have ways to play more and get your money's worth. Recommend!

o my  god...

FOR THE EMPERORRRRR

i thoroughly enjoyed the game, my only comment would be the campaign is to short. Yes i know you can do Operations for added content to see what the other squads did during your missions. Seeing as it was open ended i hope to see a sequel

Got into Warhammer 40k this year not long ago, decided to buy this game and it was worth it. Story is really nice, Visuals are amazing, the two enemies factions are fun to play against. The only bummer that I have would be the content and how paid-dlc are being done, not enough content and versatility in customisation. I mean like it would be nice to change the sigil on the helmets and as a Bulwark main I would like to change the colours of my hood and clothes. My fav chapter are the Salamanders and its sad I have to wait half a year to get my hands on their gear and cant do much with what I have currently. Overall really fun game, needs improvement, will 100% this game for sure and will be surveying this game with optimism .

This game is a "must have" for every WH40k fans. Emperor protects!

Went from 6 to midnight cutting enemies in half. Only get's better from there.

Review Score: 82

Don't buy the season pass or any additional features this game offers. It is all cosmetics and you can be as drippy as you want with the default colors and options. And it's weird too. I bought the season pass in december. The heavy champion skin is locked for me but the bulwark champion skin is unlocked which makes no sense. So it seems like if you buy the season pass in June, for example, you'll only have access to that specific champion skin and not the other ones that were released earlier which is unfair. 

Game is fun, but what a waste of 60 dollars for a season pass that isn't even like fortnite or apex legends. Please don't waste your money like I did.

Looks absolutely amazing, (but very low on content even after three months of release). "It doesn't matter how much you polish a turd, a turd is till a turd" is the phrase that comes to mind. The game play is a quite clunky and i suspect also designed for a controller rather than keyboard and mouse. Everyone i know who bought this overpriced game has uninstalled it.
No I don't hate WH40k, I love the WH40k universe and have been a fan for over 35 years.

its just good man you slauaghter xenos with a chain sword and use a machine gun to oblitarete enemys ive only played for 6 hours but i can say confidentaly a good game.Btw if u getting this game add me we can play together

Great game

A good game, not extraordinary but enjoyable. I had a good time with it, especially since I am a Warhammer 40K fan. There are some potential that could be exploited but unfortunately, in this sequel, the game hasn't had it yet. Honestly, it would be a perfect game if the developer can learn and adopt something from Helldiver 2.
Still, it is a must to go for a 40K fan! For Imperium citizen! Kill the Xenos and purge the heretic for the emperor!

hammer is a fun choice

The campaign is incredibly solid, your normal sort of Space Marine-focused story. While that may be a point against it for some, I felt it incredibly fun and entertaining.
As for the PvE and PvP, they're both extremely fun. With how much customization there is, I can easily make most any Space Marine I want (or I would, if I didn't have all my guys as Black Templars, lol). The gameplay is incredibly solid, and the lack of anything like scorestreaks is a point for me, keeping is simple and clean,
However, I will not say the game is perfect. There's a very small amount of PvP maps, and it wouldn't hurt to have a quite a few more. In addition, the heretic/chaos Space Marines have extremely little in the form of customization, and it's frustrating how all I can do with em is just a basic skin swap. 
Even so, all in all, the game is extremely fun, and I would heartily recommend it as someone's first Warhammer 40,000 experience, as it appropriately gets someone into it all.

As a kid I looked at my older brothers White Dwarves using my imagination to think about the pictures and minis within, we were way to poor to buy Warhammer but would always say imagine they had a video game were you play a space marine......and now 26yrs later we got it. GAME IS AMAZING! bought it for myself for Christmas as i play a video game once a year over the holidays. got 2 classes to lvl 25 and working on a third. BRAVO GAME DEVELOPERS, CHEFS KISS.

AWESOME GAME

very good game

If you like 40k universe this game is fantastic. Heck even if you don't and just want to enjoy a good game give it a try you won't be disappointed.

I just jogged in today to find all of my weapons at level one with no mastery points, armoury data and only 200 credits which I believe is the starting amount. i looked online for solutions and found none that worked.
I enjoy playing this game but wtf is the point if my progress can get reset all of a sudden.

Epic Online Services missing in my Steam game

This game has some of the most satisfying and fantastic game play and combat i have ever seen in a Third Person Shooter.
The updates, giving new weapons and missions for free is fantastic. 
The effort they've given to make this game absolutely gorgeous, is outstanding.

But with every update, the game becomes less stable and the game crashes, far more often.
The Balance patches, and the re-works to how combat systems work are fantastic to see!
But when i have time to play a game, and can't even finish a mission due to the game crashing, i'm left incredibly disappointed. 

I would have recommended this game at launch, but with every update, i end up more frustrated that i can't play such an amazing game consistently, to the point where i wouldn't want anyone else to waste their time.

The latest patch is a piece of bug-ridden crap. Textures now load on the fly—right on the screen—FPS drops to 10-15, everything freezes like hell, and operation load times that used to take 20-30 seconds now stretch to a freaking minute and a half.

As for melee weapon balance, there’s not much to say—neither good nor bad. You can get used to the timings. But the technical state of this patch is a solid 2 out of 10. It’s such an unfinished, pathetic mess that it actually made me write a review, which I almost never do.

The game looks awesome, so I hate to leave a negative review based on a single aspect, but having an FoV option is necessary for a lot of people, myself included, and not having it excludes us from playing. I couldn't make it past the tutorial mission before I started sweating and got sick. There's just no excuse not to include an FoV slider, as there are tons of 1st and 3rd person games that manage it just fine. If like me, you're one of those people that get sick easily from narrow FoV's, I promise this game will not be a pleasant experience for you.

To be honest, I was expecting much more from this game and I pretty much forced myself to even get 28 hours of playtime going. The campaign is great, as long as you have friends to play with, Bot AI is horribly bad and oftenly won't help you out at all.
However, the campaign is done after a few hours, leaving only PvP and repetetive Coop Missions.
Coop after campaign was very boring. Every map had the same triggers for each run, leveling up your classes felt weak, there is no real endgame and the gameplay mechanics itself are way too basic.
Joining the official Discord, you will most likely find nothing but 45+ year old boomers bragging for more skins than actual gameplay improvement.
If you are looking for a decent campaign with your friends, wait until this game drops to 30-40€. The game is more eye candy than anything else, unfortunatel.y



SPACE MARINE : NO AMMO x 2

This game has a strong foundation good graphics but its far from the hyped up perfect game so many have made it out to be. First off it runs really badly but wait its high graphics so thats okay...  no I mean on any setting. Its coded poorly and feels sluggish and clunky and every single thing you do has some unnecessary loading bar. 

Turn the game on loading bar 
Pick mode loading bar 
Use the menu loading bar
Load the level loading bar
Section loading bar
Cut scene loading
Leave the game loading bar
Leave the group loading bar

What the fk is the code doing seriously I've played so many similar games and its nothing like this.

The game overall has a good concept but its designed through the lens of a boomer that played Halo 1 back in the day and so much of this game is copied poorly from Halo 1. The concepts of low ammo like Halo 1 do not work here at all they make the game so annoying and feel like you cant play the god damn game you payed for.

Yes there are ammo refills on lower diff but the entire point of the game is to go up difficulty to unlock the better cooler weapons ala its fundamental to the enjoyment of the game to go up. I dont mind hard but the no ammo thing all the time is a terrible experience in a game to which you are more of a fat slow plodding machine. You will spend so much time fat rolling away after your ammo ran out praying your team mate has something left to give to get you to the next zone. AWFUL!

Melee is super overpowered for the simple fact that you dont need to reload and yes you may see people online blasting some creature with a powerful gun but they dont show you the hell that guy went through to get to that max level which hardly anybody has done. The balance overall is totally awful you must play certain combos at higher tiers of difficulty or its just GG because not only is the game balanced in an unfun way the enemies on higher diff are buffed in the stupidest ways. I guarantee you only 000.1% of people have 100% the classes and all weapons in this game it takes forever and is a exercise in insanity to get there.

Stat higher is not good difficulty design period and we know this and have known this for a long time. This game on higher difficulty is utterly unfun and boring turning the enemies into annoying bullet sponges which again just makes the no ammo thing unfun. It doesnt matter how clever or creative you are with your skill if you have no ammo you CANT DO ANYTHING !?!? Its awful game design. 

In the table top game yes 3 marines would not take out an entire hive army so giving them infinite ammo would have been an easy way to have a balanced trade off. Theres so many things that could have done instead like lets say make it important I hit my shots with my aim and positioning rather than just wow I exploited what little ammo I have in a cringe cheese fest. Its stupid because the majority of Space Marine armies about all about blasting xenos with GUNS not a bunch of melee stuff thats supposed to be mostly for rare special characters or specialist groups. 

SPACE MARINES most iconic main role is to stand in a line and fire bolters with massive bullets into aliens. Nothing in this game rewards or promotes that. It plays like a cringe QTE fighting game in which your action figure has to keep constantly getting close to the alien to perform an animation dance. Getting near Tyranids its supposed to be the most STUPID thing you could ever do their entire race is designed to swarm a target and hack it to death. The idea that this game promotes that space marines are great at running in and swinging a sword is mega stupid. Marines fighting up close is mostly a last resort or for these super hero like figures like Calgar. Overall do not punish people for using a gun as a space marine I cant believe I have to say this...

If it was up to me I would remove all melee weapons from all the classes but 1 so that the vast majority of players will be relying on a gun like Space Marines all do. Also where is the famous space marine flame thrower and fix the plasma and melta guns they do not operate anything like that in 40k lore. A melta gun is a deadly hot beam the punches holes through tanks its not a shotgun ?!?! All this frustration makes the annoyin clunky progression system feel like a bad job and once youve tryed everything once its hard to wanna replay anything without your friends bolstering the entertainment which they could do in any game.

The campaign is decent enough but I wouldnt replay it and I found once it switches to chaos enemies it became super annoying and unfun compared to the enjoyable feel of fighting Zerging aliens. Though I will say alot of the special enemies are mega annoying unfun to play against like the lictor or the flying shielded things. Just like in overwatch no one likes shooting sheilds all day. The game really needed more ways to CC enemies but again I guess they want you to use the boring chainsword. So many of the Tyranid shooters are super annoying and cheese and would spawn in ways that make all the fights unfun. The coposition of the mobs is just horrible way too many bullet sponge elites that you can barely dodge all at once and then with this guys shooting you and dropping AOE poison all over the floor its just not fun. 

Again the guns feel awful when they should feel powerful, a space marine bolter is akin to a rapid fire rocket launcher in reality, therefore no biological creature should be able to run through your bullets unhindered by its firepower. The game has this spongey lack of feedback feel thats just not good. When I fire a bolter accurately at a biological creature its head should be ripped clean off and there should be huge holes in any creature I fire at unless its armoured. So many times it feels like unless your using a special your guns do nothing. Which is not Space Marine and not 40k.

Overall dont get me wrong I love 40k and have for a long time but this just isnt right and for a game that relies on repeating content over and over I cant see me let alone a person outside of the 40k fandom to ever keep this game in their regular rotation. This game needed to be more like HellDivers 2 and less like Halo and my hope for improvement is pretty low as again as mentioned the core of the game seems to be running on a very poorly coded platform that is slow with trash netcode that does not facilitate the great multiplayer game this could have grown into.

For me this game is disappointing in many obvious ways but what has been made clear to me is that 40k becoming a main stream multiplayer game is very much possible and needs to happen. Lets learn from this game and make that happen in future with a more serious long term approach because what we have here is not built to last whether its made good money or not.

For the Imperium Eternally.

PS. how can you have all these great units in the game like the dreadnaught carnifex and there is no mode/way to play as them literally money down the drain...? It could have been as simple as getting in a tank like in Halo 1 ... fire this design team please god.

Also I must mention Tyranid blood is not red I can see how they got confused here given they are often covered in red blood that blood is human blood of the victims the ate.

MAKE BOLTERS GREAT AGAIN

 






Space marine 2 is an amazing game. Great visuals, animations, dialogue and atmosphere. It is a bit performance heavy though. 

Would definitely recommend it.

EMPEROR PROTECTS!

It's too buggy, maybe after a while they fix most of the bugs and release it at a bigger discount.

Unfortunately, it is simply overpriced for what is offered. Grab it for 50% off or more only.

The game crashed multiple times and the gun variety did not feel great at all. All weapons felt the same except for the firing rate, which is immediately countered by lower damage per bullet. The sword felt okay, but since it doesn't stagger big enemies, it's basically useless as YOU get staggered by them and piled on. You're also too slow to close the gaps anyways.

The setting, visuals and story are really good. The feeling of fighting against a horde is great, but feeling powerless against it did not resonate with me.

Honestly, it's the first review I've ever posted, but this game has been a big disappointment. $70 for basically 10 hours of gameplay, followed by some repetitive, fast-forward, mindless grind. Also, a $20 DLC that gives basically nothing. I bought the ultra version starting off, only to have 1 different armor for 1 CLASS that I am not even allowed to customize. The "season pass" is a joke; you can't find any information about it in the game and have to search Reddit to better understand what I paid for. Basically, I paid for some armor customization that I still have to grind for. And don't get me started on making the armor black, for example—you've got to buy like 6 different useless items before getting to the "black color" option. Just money-hungry devs.

If my PC runs cyberpunk 2077 at high 75 FPS, it shouldn't run your game on low and 30 FPS

campaign took 11 hours, kinda short for the price

Subject: Tactical Analysis of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Brothers and Sisters of the Imperium,

By the will of the Emperor, I have completed an intensive engagement with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. This interactive battle-tome delivers a visceral and glorious recounting of the Space Marines' sacred duty. Allow me to relay my findings.

From the first moment I donned the ceramite armor of Captain Titus, the sensation was nothing short of righteous. The thunderous bolter fire, the satisfying weight of the chainsword cleaving through xenos flesh—every engagement brims with fury and honor. The sounds of battle echo as if whispered by the God-Emperor Himself: the roar of engines, the crunch of Tyranids underfoot, and the ever-present war cries of "FOR THE EMPEROR!"

Visually, the battlefield is a masterwork. Each shattered hive city, every blood-soaked ruin, is rendered with such fidelity that one could almost feel the ash of destroyed worlds upon their tongue. The scale of the combat is immense, the Tyranid swarms a seemingly endless tide of claws and chitin, testing the mettle of even the most faithful Astartes. And yet, through grit and sheer determination, I prevailed—a testament to the unbreakable will of the Adeptus Astartes.

Multiplayer modes offer the camaraderie of fellow battle-brothers and the thrill of coordinated assaults against the Great Devourer. Teamwork is not only encouraged—it is essential. To charge headlong into the swarm without a plan is folly, even for a genetically engineered super-soldier.

As for the tale itself, it burns with the righteousness of a holy saga. Captain Titus' return to the battlefield after a decade in exile is a story of redemption, defiance, and duty. To delve deeper would rob you of the sacred experience. Suffice it to say, the Emperor watches over every step of this journey.

There are some minor quibbles—a rare glitch in the holy code here, an occasional repetition in battlefield cries there—but these are as insignificant as a speck of dust upon the shining armor of the Chapter.

Verdict: 9.5/10 Bolters.

Brothers, if you have ever wished to feel the fury of the Space Marines coursing through your veins, to smite the enemies of the Emperor with unwavering zeal, then you must partake in this divine offering.

game crashes too much, some bugs cause my entire pc to reboot, get the black screen when launching alot, gets dropped online alot when playing with friends... not stable... just wait till 2025 for hte game to be fixed...

Burn the heretic. Kill the mutant. Purge the unclean. It is better to die for the Emperor than to live for yourself!

[h1]The Inquisition can find no taint of heresy in this worthy successor to a 40K legend.[/h1]

[list]
 [*]+ The IP that brought the visceral combat and what it truly feels to be an Adeptus Astartes, executed by the numbers to perfection. The tone, breadth, and feel just shows that the people behind this game live and breathe the IP as much as the fans.

 [*]+ Visual spectacle that captures the scale and scope of the IP very well. Striking blues of Ultramarines against the blood and gore of Tyranids, against the gothic backdrop of its settings scream quality all throughout, all delivered at a solid clip even at the worst of [i]chaotic[/i] forays on screen.

 [*]+ Well-delivered VA work alongside solid writing adds another layer of quality on top of what is already on show. The story is straight up 40k, and directly follows the events following the original Space Marine, culminating in a solid 10-15ish hour experience.

 [*]+ That is just the beginning however. Many points in the campaign directly reference a second or even third team involved, [i]and you can play as that team in co-op[/i]! This alone extends what's on offer to well past that initial figure. Oh, and the same solid PvP multiplayer on offer is also not bad.

 [*]+ At time of this review, they have just released a new patch that added even more to the game's multiplayer offerings, which bodes well to after-release support moving forward.

 [*]- Whilst the game itself is a magnum opus of a 40K rendition, it is odd that certain elements that were in the first game did not survive the transition to a new dev studio (unlike what is depicted in the game "crossing the Rubicon"). Its the small things such as the sound of bolter fire seemingly less.. bombastic than before. Melee impacts outside of really big weapons feel only functional, and not impactful, denying the true strength of these space marines and what they fight against. Game's audio balancing seems a bit lacking in the lower bass regions too.

 [*]- The difficulty in understanding Mechanicus Tech-Priests' dialogue, whilst accurate, can be unnecessarily grating on one's ears, requiring subtitle use just to make sense of what is said. Whilst it is accurate to lore, it is a bit too much. Similar situations can be found around the game's campaign as well with other bits of dialogue, seemingly more fitting to require subtitles just to understand what is spoken with some clearer contexts involved.

[*]- By the numbers, and no further. The noticeable "safe" development and execution, whilst excellent, is a criminal disservice to the IP. Then again, the argument that trying to push beyond what is safe may end up flopping and thus ruining the game for it... This is why we are not burdened with the job of an Inquisitor of the Holy Inquisition. We cannot fully judge the taint of heresy, from what is truly Emperor-touched unlike they can. (Hell they sometimes can't even do that in the first place...)

 [*]- The Eternal War (PvP multiplayer) feature is sadly not an evolution of the original Space Marine 1's multiplayer, but a remake. It does not reach the heights that both the campaign or the coop missions make to, and only feels solid, and no further.

 [*]- Upon start of the game, it scans for the Epic Launcher files in an apparent attempt to see crossplay support. On a Steam release. This is not a good look.

 [*]- Paid cosmetics DLC's seem rather pricey for what you end up getting.

Short campaign like the first but more action packed with a decent amount of other PVE/PVP sections you can play with your friends.

I played this with two friends from beginning to end.  The campaign was amazing.  From beginning to end and I can recommend the game for that alone.  But we played the post-game campaign as well.  And while it was fun, it was clear that it was trying to have the same kind of replayability as Vermintide.  And to it's credit, it actually does so to a degree even better than Darktide, but it's not enough to really facilitate the kind of replayability it wants.  All the class progressions are just some form of, "do thing 10% faster", "thing does 10% more damage" nothing really cool that changes how the classes actually play.  And this really kills any momentum to re-play missions.  So I'd recommend grabbing some friends, going through the campaign once, and the post-game missions once.  There is PvP but it's kind of trash?  Like, we only played 3 rounds, and despite Anti-Cheat infecting the game, there were still hackers one-shotting us across the map through walls.  So I'd avoid PvP entirely.

Also, the customizable armor should have been available from the very beginning and not locked behind post game.  But that's just a nit-pick.

I guess I finally have to admit to myself that games like these have lost most of their appeal to me.
It feels good, looks great, but after 2-3h it feels like there's nothing left to see, do or achieve. It feels like a ton of pomp but very little circumstance. The pomp is AAA class, no question about it, the WH 40K vibe is, as far as I can tell, also next to nothing, but after 30 years of gaming great optics are just not nearly enough anymore to keep me motivated if the core gameplay has given away everything it has to offer after a mere 2 hours, especially not if playing solo. Might be more fun in MP. 
Could have easily been made more engaging by adding a couple more elements to the gameplay instead of just plain "get from A to B, push a few buttons and kill everything in the way", for example a few basic weapon progressions, a tiny bit more of skill development, a very basic form of gear choice that would bring more excitement and freedom. As far as I can tell none of that exists, it's all just cosmetic. 

Bottom line: not nearly enough content to justify the price in 2024, lost all motivation after 3h. The great world design and artistic quality can't make up for the lack of an actual game. Wanted to love it, but Alas...

Super ultrawide not supported without a 3rd party patch that may result in you getting banned. Additionally unable to rebind controller in game, updating controller binding via steam and now the control is not being picked up in game. Keyboard and mouse feels sluggish to use.

[!SPOILERS!]
________________________________________
Story
It starts with the player playing as Titus, the main protagonist. He is serving in Deathwatch, a group of space marines who were accused of heresy (f*** you, Leandros). Its sort of like penal labor. He served there for about a hundred years. Based on his activity during this time, and almost sacrificing himself in a battle, he was reinstated as an Ultramarine.
He is then assigned as the leader of a group of ultramarines. Everyone respected him, except for Gadriel (and the Chaplin, who’s Leandros), until he did. Long story short, another Leandros shenanigan was in motion, but Gadriel is a bro, so it didn’t. Other than that, the whole story is about the group proving their worth, Titus proving his loyalty, and Ultramarines showing how bada** they are. The best part is how each character development occurred through the course with no cheesy dialogue/monologue.
9/10
________________________________________
Gameplay
Shoot, slash, smash, impale. These are the basic attacks. Its crucial to make as many headshots as possible, because bodyshots take forever to kill. When out of ammo, or facing minoris level enemies, melee attacks are optimal. Try to use combo, especially the one that stomps on the ground/enemy’s face to shock/slow them down for a while to give you some time and space to shoot/melee attack with the intent to kill. Apart from that, there are dodge rolls/jumps, parry, and execution (which is sick af, although some players find it annoying as it slows down the pace, or breaks the combat flow). The balancing was done nicely, but it also made most of the weapons weak af. 
Finding the best weapon is up to you. Finding the best class is also up to you. But when you find the perfect build for you in PvE, it will most likely be mediocre at best in PvP.
8/10
________________________________________
Visuals
In a very short moment, you’ll realize the high the stakes are. The scale of the battle is huge. Every single element of the world design seems perfect, including character movements, facial expressions, different animations, even ragdolling and cloth movement animation. The NPC behavior is accurate. The scale of the battle is epic. The visuals are amazing.

Nice. That’s all I’ll say.

Almost no bugs. The game feels optimized. However, loading time felt a bit longer, although that’s probably because of my ancient system. But one thing that has been an issue for me is the sudden disconnection, and I’m pretty sure that my net connection is more than ok.

For The Emperor/10

Very beautiful game, gives fantastic vibes, it' just a joy to pass time in it and you feel it loves you back. If it was a person it would have been an Aku.

If you want the male fantasy of being able to crush your enemies with egregious weapons of war while screaming "brother" you'll be in love with the contents that lay herein.

The reason of a thumb up not required.
Review not required.
Faith and service is the only requirement.

The Emperor has called on you to Purge all who threaten the Imperium.
Do not hesitate and do not falter.
Kill all do who not love the Emperor !!!

Play as the blueberry boy scouts in a tale of trucking your fist through another beings face

Great game, but please overhaul your dlc stuff to be available after you purchase said sh!t because you guys are basically ripping off the consumer, and I ain't a fan of that attitude/scam.

Th universe of WH40K is awesome.

The persons who embrace woke ideology and desire romance options, trans, and female space marines...

...you people need Jesus Christ, badly.

Consume your protien shake within an hour of working out and play this game to hit the perfect anabolic window.

good game but a lot of game loading simulator

This is a really good shooter action RPG with no crap included by some idiotic modern people who ruin games. Enjoy a real warhammer atmosphere and a nice main character who talks less and shoots more. Most importanly, he cannot be ruined. He is always the same - good old Titus, a strong man with a huge gun and heavy armor, what is not to like... I really like warhammer and I enjoy this game even though I do not play shooters in general

It's hard to think of Space Marine 2 as a sequel. Although it picks up the story of Titus after the events of the first game, there is so much more to experience.

The story is great, no spoilers here, but the setting itself drips with so much detail you can't help but become transported to M41. There are stories upon stories to be told within the ancient worlds and inconceivable structures you'll traverse. This game is a labor of love for everything 40K.

SM1's hack & slash combat is replaced by a new, dynamic and challenging mix of melee, ranged, and defensive tactics. It feels familiar, paying homage to the original while presenting a system that is light years ahead of its predecessor. The difficulty curve from easiest to hardest is really nicely handled with an appropriate & rewarding bump in challenge at each tier. After around 125 hours, I hit a 'completion' milestone in PVE operations with every class and weapon at max rank, every mission completed at the highest difficulty, and all unlockable cosmetics earned. I've continued to play for hours at a time without anything left to earn just because it's just [b]FUN.[/b] That said, the roadmap for upcoming content is quite titillating.

I won't review the PVP modes as I've only played a couple of rounds and wasn't hooked, but I didn't go in with high expectations either. It seems to be the least popular aspect of the game, so if future updates bring improvements or overhauls I'll give it another try.

Skulls for the Golden Throne! This game is outstanding, and in my opinion, it has already outshone Dark Tide. The potential for its future is undeniable, and it must continue to expand content if it wants to achieve greatness. If the developers introduce new factions for PvE gameplay, it will undoubtedly solidify its reputation as the best Warhammer 40,000 game in history.

The best game of the year packed with hours of gameplay and enjoyment, well made campaign and operations and robust pvp and being true to the 40k universe this has to be one of the top games i've ever played

Requiring the Epic Games launcher to be installed on your PC for multiplayer access when purchasing the app through Steam should honestly be criminally punishable.

Animation lock central. This really isn't hard as much as it's annoying. Dropping my controls when I'm trying to survive is really not fun or fair. I'd rather go back and play Deathwing.

Another developer that can't update a game without breaking a bunch of stuff, terrible.

My drivers are up to date and the game is still crashing constantly. This clearly needed more time in the oven. I'd pass on this for now and wait for a steep discount in a few years.

Space Marine 2 looks, sounds, and plays fantastic. The sheer size and scale of the battles you participate in is phenomenal. Best of all, despite being a western game, it miraculously is not woke or self-indulgent, and instead embraces masculinity and stoicism.

This is the experience we've all been starving for!


Embody the superhuman skill and brutality of a Space Marine. Unleash deadly abilities and devastating weaponry to obliterate the relentless Tyranid swarms. Defend the Imperium in spectacular third-person action in solo or multiplayer modes.

LOVE Warhammer 40k! Lots of fun, awesome views and a cool glimpse of Imperial life in the grim darkness of the far future. :D

Mechanically well designed, fun story. But for a game that is 2/3 Multiplayer the net code is terrible. During peak hours massive lag spikes cause enemies to teleport around the map and "forget to die" until your connection catches up, interactive object to stop being usable, and abilities to stop recharging properly. All this while the game is telling you you have a ping of between 14 and 50ms.

Not recommended. Fun until you beat the campaign, at which point you realize you bought a game that you can basically only play 1/3 of.

This game renewed my faith that developers can still make fun AAA quality action games without filling it with useless bloat and predatory monetization practices. Space Marine 2 feels like a classic Xbox 360 title in all the best ways. Its story is interesting and keeps you engaged but its not trying to say anything profound. Fact of the matter is you're here to slaughter some Xenos in the thousands and defend humanity for the Emperor. 

The game play is where Space Marine 2 really shines. The blend of Gears of War like game play (the main difference being a more complex melee system and not being able to take cover) with a DOOM like execution system leads to some absolutely amazing fights where you're truly living out your power fantasy of being a Space Marine always on the edge of defeat but ripping and tearing dozens enemies with extreme prejudice and when its over and your character is covered in blood and surrounded by Xenos corpses, you feel a rush not many other games give you.

In terms of modes, the story is very fun with some great moments but doesn't have a whole lot of reason to replay it. The main replayability comes from operations mode where you and 2 other friends choose from 6 classes. With these classes you will earn new perks for your character and weapons as you play 8 missions (so far) that run parallel to the main story but contain randomly generated encounters that keep things fresh for multiple playthroughs. As you increase your level you will be able to increase the difficulty and face tougher enemies with bigger rewards. Finally we have PVP where I think Saber made its biggest misstep in this game. The PVP itself is incredibly fun and they truly have something special here, the problem is the content. There are only 3 modes that can be played on 3 maps, that's it. It truly is a shame that they haven't done more with this mode. Its fortunate that the PVE in this game is so good because 3 maps is a pathetically small amount of content for such a fun mode and its unfortunate that the devs aren't planning on adding anything to PVP until sometime first quarter next year. I feel by that point the interest in the mode will have completely fizzled out.

To end on a positive note the graphics and scenery in this game are truly amazing and many times I found myself just admiring my surroundings. I highly recommend this game for fans of third person shooters even if you don't know anything about Warhammer going into it like I did.

Devs keep making unnecessary changes and it feels like I'm dealing with Helldivers 2 all over again. I'm tired of dodges and parries not working consistently when I need them to survive. Also, it's a major grind-fest. Completing operations does not feel rewarding in the slightest.

It would be an insta-buy if they put bolt guns in the game. Being a space marine, but having to use a nerf gun just doesn't have the same impact. 

Also the melee is pretty mid.

Put a 150 hours into it... I can't recommend this game... I wanna as a huge 40k fan. Ive run 80% of the weapons up to relic completed all operations on ruthless, some on lethal. Campaign is good. The rest of the game is just not. PVP is meh... kinda boring. Stun lock by certain attack chains. Clear meta, not everything is viable. The biggest problem, getting into an operation with the class you want to play can take 3-5 attempts and the loading screens are atrocious. Fighting most of the enemies is ok, until you run into a proper horde then everything the game taught you goes out the door. The game needs work. A lot of it. It took Darktide 2 years to get its act together. I hope this game doesn't take near as long.

Unless it's on sale for $20, don't bother. It's pretty good, but there simply isn't enough content to justify such a high price tag.

-The campaign is good, but only about 6-7 hours long.
-There is a co-op mode, but it is mainly just side missions associated with the campaign. It only adds a couple more hours of content.
-PvP mode just flat out blows. The game wasn't made with PvP in mind and it clearly shows.

Incredibly slow updates, very repetitive because of that.
Discord ran by Zionists.

Campaign was actually really fun and operations seem to have quite a lot of content to progress in. Overall I really enjoyed space marine 2 despite it being my first 40k game.

I have 162 hours in this game. The game is lots of fun when you encounter no bugs! and let me tell, the game is full with bugs. 
1- Match making is a nightmare, you have to quit to the title screen many time to fix the offline mode issue.
2- Game loading sometimes takes forever.
3- After the last patch, the game is unplayable with all the Stupid changes. Even the mouse is not working some times!!
4- the list goes on and on.......

For now,  it is not worth getting the game even if it is on sales!!



Main campaign is fine story wise, just too short. If you only buy the game for the main campaign buy it on sale as its only about 7 hours long. Visually the game is absolutely stunning and it ran smooth like butter 13900k, 3080ti 

I would have given it 7-8/10 if not for the absolute dogwater dlc behaviour. so a 5/10 will suffice




Never have I ever bought a game that chrash when i change video settings to LOW.
Never have I ever bought a game that freeze in the first 5 seconds of the opening cinematics.
Never have I ever thought about refunding a game until now, 5/5 GREAT WORK.

Looks great and really captures the 40k setting well! But the campaign is pretty short, there's only so much content in co-op, and the gameplay is pretty much watered down musou-style combat with guns. Buy it at half off or less unless you're really into Space Marines conceptually.

i like the game and had fun but i didn't get the stuff i was suppost to when i bought the game. had fun thou

I've long wanted a game that simply shows you some overdramatic space marine action and this is it.

Graphics: Top, in some places too good for my computer

Gameplay: Hell yeah

Story: A lot of people say they don't like the story because it doesn't make sense from a lore point of view.
And I understand that, but I don't think there's really a lore-faithful Warhammer video game that shows action the way this game does. I mean, Boltgun or any Dawn of War Game is a violation of the lore in itself.

Price: The side missions and main game are fine, but not enough for $80.
I think you really get your money's worth with the multiplayer, but I personally don't really care about that, since i bought the Game for PvE action only.

Conclusion:
9.3/10

when game launched i had this running on window mode 2560x1440 window mode! NEVER HAD A PROBLEM ON MY WIDE SCREEN, 
This game is pissing me the hell off!, ever since they launch this wide screen bull crap, it sucked big time. TRY THE WIDE SCREEN FEATURE, its not even good at all! Got back to usual settings on windowed and now every time i play it keeps tabbing the hell out like! YO! PVP and in PVE! I cant even believe i paid full price on launch for this crap! ITS UNPLAYABLE AT THIS POINT STILL TO THIS DAY since that specific update. SHIT!

This unfortunatly ain't it, Brothers.

The campaign is a nice cinematic experience but extremely short. The combat system is a bunch of glorified QTE with some unimpactful ranged options on top.This sounds boring and it is for the most part. The biggest letdown is the missing feeling of pure Astartes might you got from the first game. You stomped through hordes of orcs dropping fools left and right and it was glorious.
Here you hunker down and hope for a parry window or some executions to get your shields back. In higher difficulties you feel hillariously underpowered.

The PvE multiplayer part (operations) is nicely tied in with the campaign but ultimately gets butchered by its million loading screens and terrible netcode. You're going to look at loading screens for minutes before you see any Astartes action at all. Then the whole combat system collapses in itself, when the game expects you to perfect parry for survival with terrible lag.

operations are fun and challenging. Operations have a good amount of replayability.

This game does not support changing your field of view, and the developers have made dismissive remarks of this essential accessibility feature. Mods are available and working, enabling me to play the campaign, but appear to be patch dependent, such that they will break whenever the game updates.

The game itself is fun if you manage to wait through extremely long loading times and continuous disconnections from the server...

Crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes crashes while start the game...........................

Good if you have friends to play it with, or if you are a big W40k fan.

If that's not the case then skip. Like nearly all other 40k games SM2 gets the atmosphere of the setting right and is overprized and underdelivers in gameplay aspects. Both gunplay and melee combat are mediocre at best. Level design and your options to traverse through them is poor, yes the levels "wear" a shiny coat of 40k related decorations but then you'll find yourself stopped by tiny fences and the levels are nothing but disguised tubes. Gameplay wise, on top of everything the game doesn't do anything with the concept of the main character being a space marine. The character is taller than the regular humans running around but what he does is the same. No amazing feats of strength, marksmanship, speed or tactical acumen here.

Playing Titus is like playing a character from early 3D adventure games, he moves slow, he changes weapons slow, he carries a pistol, a rifle and a melee weapon and he'll never get any interesting weapons because the game limits itself to standard shooter equivalents - slow shooting rifle, fast shooting rifle, shotgun, heavy weapon that fires fast, heavy weapon that fires in an arc.

Melee is limited in its own way. You have one button for attacking, keep it pressed for an AOE attack and you can dodge and block/parry. There are indicators for special attacks you can and can't parry but you can also parry regular attacks, overall it feels like the devs liked the Arkham Batman games but didn't want to commit to that style of combat. In theory you have combos but in practice you'll never need them. Every regular encounter will find you surrounded by tiny enemies with one or two bigger ones.

Every "boss" fight is nothing but a slog against a bullet sponge (even on the lowest difficulty).

Story wise - well, it is a 40k story, which means uninspired and basic and if anyone says they were suprised by Leandros from the first game showing up at the end, I'll call them a liar, not that there is any emotional weight to him revealing himself, the game does nothing to earn that, actually it does less than nothing - if you haven't played the first Space Marine game you won't have any clue why this guy should matter

Also get used to the idea that Titus has brain damage and makes a lot of very silly call-outs to his team - like warning them that there are enemies in a facility after you just fought a bunch at the entry of said facility

Instead of another in depth, fully rounded out experience like SM1, you get this. A bland, repetitive mindless grind of operations and awful PvP. Don't pay full price for this game, even if you're in to warhammer. The PvP is laughably unbalanced and not particularly fun (flash grenade spam is just bad design), the operations are repetitive but can be initially fun (until you go around and around again and again, and no duplicate classes? WTF? It's not like they build out a squad to fulfill a specific role in a task force or anything... "Sorry guys, only I get the heavy bolter. We need to be fair against the myriad of threats arrayed against humanity." at some point you will absolutely load into a round and have an awkward standoff with a random who doesn't want to change classes, even though you were there first as said class.**The match wont start until you have 3 different classes selected**), it's saving grace is absolutely the campaign, though that is unacceptably short for $70. You can also see thinly veiled assets in the campaign that they just recycled into their Operations mode. (or maybe assets for boring and repetitive operations recycled into a campaign they felt obligated to tack on... you be the judge) It's really a shame because the legacy of SM1 could've lived on and continued, but no, they chose a discount brand dev studio to pump out something largely mindless and vanilla. And don't even get me started on the obligatory DEI squad. Pick this up STEEPLY discounted and play with friends in private lobbies, with those boxes checked you can actually get some fun out of this game.

If the matchmaking servers worked I would be satisfied with this game but unfortunately they hardly ever work requiring you to go out to the main menu and reload the game in order for you to try again. 2/3rds of the game is basically unplayable because of this and has been that way for months. They seem to be more interested in releasing cosmetic DLC packs than fixing their servers. I can't possibly recommend this game at this price maybe if you can catch it on sale for 25 dollars it would be worth it by that point the game will be dead so it won't matter that the servers don't work.

This game is a mediocre disappointing cash grab that attempts to cash-in on the success of the first Space Marine game. The combat and controls are clunky, the story is threadbare, and the missions are repetitive and boring. It is designed to be a forced multiplayer because the AI bots that "assist" you in the campaign and the operations missions are lackluster. They will fight the enemies but they won't defend objectives when you are being swarmed and have to do things such as keeping enemies from trashing multiple generators or multiple antenna arrays.

Space Marine 2 is a D+ at worst and a C- at best. It is a miscarriage of a game.

Every single mission in the campaign is a repeat of a particular template. Advance across a map populated by three types of enemies, Tyranid Hormagaunts, Termagaunts, Warriors, and occasionally the odd Lictor or Ravener.  Shoot them, hack and slash, move from one execution performance to another to boost shields and armor. Take some key feature, power up a console by interacting with it, then hold against waves that try to damage generators, antenna arrays, or elevator chains… None of the missions have any unique flavor.

If you're into the Warhammer 40k universe, especially the lore, you're much better off with Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine (1st game) or Warhammer 40,000 Death Watch.

Space Marine 2 is way over-typed and it simply isn't enjoyable, it plays like something that was poorly thought out, poorly coded, with a poor interface, slapped together, and rushed to the market to cash in on the success of the first Space Marine game. It does not contribute productively to the Space Marine franchise. It is just a naked cash grab.

I will say, on the plus side for Space Marine 2, the down time periods between missions, the time spent on the Space Marine’s Battle Barge, the graphics, the scenery, the surroundings, are amazing and spectacular. It is truly immersive and you actually feel like you are a Space Marine roaming around on the ship preparing to deploy to smash the enemies of mankind. The atmosphere on the Battle Barge is definitely the Grim Dark of the 40K universe. It is unfortunate that this atmosphere is taking place in a boring clunky game with an uninspired plot that is just a repackaged rehash of stuff that was already done earlier and elsewhere.

I have tried hard to like this game as I am a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe and especially the lore. However, this game is clunky, combat is an uninspired slog, the missions are dull, repetitive, bland, unimaginative, and cliche. The game just falls flat in every regard except the visuals.


The game has so much unrealized potential. It isn't a worthy heir or successor to the first Space Marines game.

The single-player campaign is fine. It has very a very simplistic plot about soldiers not trusting each other. If you want a depiction is massive hordes of monsters and soldiers doing battle, this game will please you immensely. It is terribly well (as in very, very, very good) optimized. I did not experience stuttering or lag even once despite hundreds of bugs on screen. The nail in the coffin, however, is the writing. It is a very boring and flat story about Titus and his new squad not trusting each other. It even uses the same macguffin as the first game.

I really wanted to get my money's worth in the multiplayer but it is sadly very lacking. Your upgrades to become stronger, and your cosmetics share a resource. An Operation gives exactly 35 currency on the lowest difficulty. The cosmetics all cost 40. The fact that the cosmetics share a resource with the perks and weapon upgrades is a travesty in a game with such a robust cosmetics system.

By far the biggest sin is the utter lack of customization in the PvP. You cannot customize your character in PvP. Playing a Chaos Assault? You're a Night Lord. Don't like that? Too bad. All of your customization is only for Operations and nothing else. It would be so rad to play a full squad of one specific chapter with my friends but sadly it is simply not possible despite there being literally zero reasons why it can't be done.

The price is not worth it, but if it's on sale for $20–25, it's worth the purchase.

Ah, yes.  Yet another game that, because it just [i]had[/i] to have [b]Easy Anti-Cheat[/b], crashes my computer on launch.

Fuck off with EAC already.

Great game, really enjoyed it. But the content is NOT worth 60 euro.

It's empty, boring and the progression is stale.
Endgame is cosmetics, which there are only few of

In the end I find it ok but mostly Meh and Mid. Too much grind for the same missions and pvp you have to replay. Also Skins are locked and are not clear on the pass or DLC. Cross-play does not work well for finding brothers on other platforms. You have to grind so much for so little. Most people working longer hours or multiple jobs who has the time for this grind?????  Even the new dark angels dlc is very misleading. TBH I enjoyed the campaign immensely however it was too short for me. Next game I hope they implement more single player things, such as custom character, maybe some RPG aspects, please someone else besides a fracking Ultramarine, enough smurfs. Decent ride just would not have bought the pass if I knew before hand the details. Overall id give a 7 out of 10. Great for the single player but not the price. The core game mechanics and game play are above par and feel amazing. I would have enjoyed more of the co-op and pvp but I dont want to play the same 6 missions and maps for 20 hours to unlock what I want. I would not recommend until they fix the pass details. Maybe if since I own the pass I could get an instant unlock on something would have been nice or something beside the just getting the option to grind for them.  - A man with bills to pay

Very little like the original, where the main story was single-player only. Instead, Space Marine 2 actively punishes the player for playing solo. [spoiler] Walking through an early stage, the squad requires a Space Marine to clear the way with a flamer. It's a two-handed weapon and neither of the two bots are going to pick it up, so it's up to the player character. And they're not going to intercept other foes, so you're stuck trying to decide: stick with the flamer that the regular enemies don't seem to mind, or abandon the flamer to fight the regular foes and get shredded by the rippers? [/spoiler] It's survivable, but I honestly feel like the people who developed this levels sought to force players into online play where other players may not have the patience to watch a first-time player explore everything, watch every cutscene or listen to every vox recording.

Even when I was playing multiplayer, I found it to be SUPER grindy. Only nine multiplayer operations (aside from the story campaign). The lowest difficulty took a little practice but my characters are around level 9 and can handle every operation I've seen at the lowest difficulty. But there's a BIG step up to that second level of difficulty. Not nearly as many people available for matchmaking at level 2 and even then, every group I've been in has been destroyed early in the operation, so either everyone's terrible or the game devs intentionally created these big swings in difficulty to incentivize players to mercilessly grind each level of difficulty, which is both exceedingly tedious and 100% on-brand for Workshop Games.

My PC restarts every time i finish a level or exit the game. Its sad really because the game is great...

Amazing game, great story line and kick ass game play. If you enjoyed the first this will not let you down.

Game *was* awesome but they released a patch a week ago that's broken the game - can't rebind keys from the annoying defaults. Zero announcement/recognition/timeline for a fix from devs about this issue. Apparently also a lot of people can't use their mouse sporadically.
Definitely not worth buying in this state.

Minor disappointments:
1. UI sux. Character took too much space(they are in gumdam suits make them further from my screen), no where to check perks trees in game.
2. TOO MANY LOADING SCREENS, wanna do some operations? let's load three times first!
3. Grinding is NOT fun while there are only limited choices(especially the best strategy is to repeat the one you are most familiar with) More operations or flexible ways to obtain XP.
4. exp system is not complete, IMO each game too little exp and giving extra 10 XP for being top on those bonus categories is an insult!
5.PC adaption is simply bad, 10 level of sensitivity on a FPS game? You kidding. repeat key binding currently not available(the default interact/finisher bound to E, i want them both bound to F, cant do it) 
Hold or toggle for aim? why not both like PUBG since you took right click as melee, either one can cause inconvenience without mentioning the sprinting to unscope sometimes just don't work. 
6.Quest updates/announcements sometimes block crosshair(I mean field of view when the fight is still in progress), and you cant customize crosshair(for no scope weapon mid-range shot starts to cause pain in the butt)hit feedbacks are great but make it as simple as possible if you don't offer a choice.

Played for 40 hrs enjoying most of the time with some swear words out of mouth. Not unplayable, just not that fun to play.
Hope these get fixed.

There are more serious issues with PvP, but since I only did a couple, no comments.

Cannot recommend for singleplayer. I was expecting a solid solo campaign. But it's just a short series of separate levels designed for co-op. 

The spectacle is amazing though. And the combat is much more fun than in the first game.

I got the game on early with the ultimate edition and have 212hrs as of writing this. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty both in the story and in the co-op operations on every single level. I have all but two achievements except getting all the collectibles  and the other is getting every achievement. I maxed every class and fully upgraded all the weapons I was interested in. I've made some pretty optimal builds and don't really struggle at all on any class, any difficulty, or any map in the co-op so I'm not sure what all the other reviews gripes are about the combat. They nerfed the fencing mechanic but it still doesn't seem very hard at all, tried the new map on lethality difficulty and got it done first try, no deaths(only played the new map twice, super boring). The game just isn't built for longevity and the game play loop gets boring very fast. I played the newest Dark Angel update just enough to unlock all the new cosmetics and now won't touch the game until the next content update. The pvp is done very poorly and I'm not sure why but it seems like they need to add some beefiness to the pvp or something. I think adding stim packs would make the marines last longer because as of right now if you get beamed by one person you die pretty fast, let alone two people. I think the game could benefit from a gears and war duck and cover system because it just feels clunky, however I understand the space marines are in huge armor suits but honestly that's just what the game is missing in my opinion. I think a clamber and jump ability would also be great because again, the game-play just feels slow and clunky. Space marines are supposed to be agile and fast but they feel very grandpa like. I had high hopes for the game but the player count is just 10k on steam right now and that's not looking good at all. Save your money until the game is discounted, it's just not worth it in it's current state. I haven't had any mouse and keyboard hardware issues or any problems remapping keys but I just thought I'd mention that because other people are complaining about it in more recent reviews. It's sad to see because I love the 40k universe but this game just does it no justice.

Research this games issues before you BUY!! I couldnt even play it because it locks into my intergrated graphics (intel) instead of my RTX 3060. I tried for hours and struggled 20mins after altering something in bios. I literally had no display and had to strategically remember what buttons to press to find the option i changed in my bios..... Never again. If another game does this, its an instant return if possible. Unplayable for me.

Told me to update my graphics driver to play, okay cool no problem. Now I can enjoy every menu in the game being a disgusting pixelated mess. Oh wait, no I can't cause after finishing the tutorial mission any attempt to connect to the server is met with an immediate crash. I meet the recommended specs, followed your instructions, it don't work. Half of the one hour of playtime is launching the game.

cannot play with friends. it is completely broken. the game crashes every time after you accept the invite.

mic is on by default, also console players cant see the chat so u cant tell them about it unless u warn them via VC lmao

The game is pretty good but the environment is first rate. The Dialogue is true to the books, the story is well aligned, and if just feels like your in a 40k story. The game play is a bit grindy but i never tire of killing the enemies of the emperor. So far so good.

Blind and Stupid fun is all I can say for this game. it is everything it says it is on the box without any wasted filler. While some games have some sort of agenda or some stupid message to say. This is just blind, chaotic fun for the sake of fun.
Multiplayer is solid if lacking in content for the moment but as with all things give this game time and it will be a classic like its original outing years ago.
The story is simple but easy to follow with lots of fun story points. while its not going to be written to be the next Titanic its still fun to watch and enjoy the story and how it doesn't hold your hand.
Its Warhammer 40k, if you don't know whats going on its because you don't have the info from the lore, that's fine, a simple wiki read will get you up to date.
This game does have flaws but it outshines them with the absolute amount of fun it brings to the table.
I highly recommend this game for any Warhammer 40k fan and the friends who love shooters.

The Emperor protects.

Loved the Campaign but I'm now coming to terms that there just isn't much meat to this game's bones.. PVE was fun but now it's just incredibly repetitive and the PVP is... unremarkable. I'm going back to Helldivers 2 until Horde mode comes out and then I'll probably find a reason to complain about that too.

I changed the parry controls to the Q button and the c button to using abilities. But it can't be used after update 5.0. It's not fun at all and the team can't fix it as of now.

The "Quick Match" needs a massive over haul. Keeps putting me in a group with character of the same class or forcing me to select another than the one I want to play. Have to join as another class and drop simply to look for another group for the class I want to play.

Being forced to parry and dodge in quick time like pop ups is ridiculous in a shooter game. The game is great, but this mechanic ruins the experience, as it can wipe out your group when everyone misses too many of these QTEs.
