Directors Cut --- Come on now! Lets av it. Lot of fluff shitting on this game which in my mind was an absolute banger. Directors Cut, Hogwarts 2... FTW!

its good

YES

Interesting storyline, impresive combat mechanics with huge world. Overall it was really enjoyable, waiting forward for second game. 

However all the characters felt really different than in the Harry Potter franchise in a bad way. To be more precise it felt like american remake of Hogwarts- where it takes original and makes it a lot worse with random modern changes.

Morover student life is really lacking, you just get some lessions that are pretty much cinematic and that's all. I think this part should improve a lot in the next game cause this is one of the most interestingparts in Harry Potter...

Not my cup tea

Its a great game and has plenty of content.

good game

Excellent game to just exit reality and enter the Harry Potter universe.

The game is transphobic

A masterpiece crafted with love, and probably along with long hours of overtime.

I am greatly enjoying this game. I am on my second play through currently. I enjoy the story and the characters you befriend along the way. I do wish that your actions had consequences, such as being punished for learning forbidden magic or your choices along the main story line leading to alternative endings instead of all choices leading to the same ending. Maybe they will do that in a future update. 

4/5 stars

The creator of the series has a brain. Very good gameplay as well.

Great game, easy to play with a good story and plenty to explore and do on the side. I have played it through twice and attempting to 100% at the moment.

Love it. I felt completely immersed in the fantastical world of wizards, witches, goblins and beasts. 

It's way too easy though. I played on the hardest difficulty and there's this constant feeling of being completely overpowered. Maybe because I'm the kind of player that wants to really complete a game and not just the main story so I picked up every quest I could and collected everything I could. Maybe you're not supposed to do that and instead just pick a few quests that seem interesting? Anyhow, the result was that I played on hardest difficulty yet can finish the game (and non-main-quest-extras) without any real challenge. 

It's kinda awkward how the quests (and stories that go with it) are dispersed. It often just doesn't make sense. Awkard to hear your character and other npcs talk about how dangerous Ranrok is while you already defeated him long time ago. Awkward to have Sebastian (a quest giver) at different places at the same time because you have multiple quests going on with him. Awkward to stumble upon places you visited many times, but this time it triggers some things when you get there because you're on a certain quest so this time you're character is like 'ahh so this must be that place she was talking about' as if you get there for the first time. Awkward to finish the main quest, have the ending ceremony and closure of the school year, then keep on going in the same time and place, meaning the school is still full of students and all npc's talk as if the school year isn't done yet. Awkward to suddenly have level-15 quests opening up while you're already at level 38 so the little challenge these quests are supposed to give is gone as well. 

But having my own baby unicon chasing bubbles in my self-created/conjured little paradise is the cutest thing I'll ever see.

Played this for 5 hours and I'm already bored out of my mind. It's like watching a movie. A poorly written one too. It needs less Q_Q and more pewpew.

its a game

Its Good. Play It.

Awsome game

Amazing story brilliant immersive experience need headphones to get the full effect can't wait for the the next in the series

GG

Optimization is trash, but the game looks amazing !!!

Very nice game

Love this game. Objectively it's a competently made game but doesn't do anything in a stand out way I guess, but I love the setting the music and the feeling of the game, so for me that elevates it a lot. I found this game really fun. Very comfy.

yes

Never imagined to live out magical hogwarts world, but this game delivered It very well!

Cant burn down the school

sebastian, my morally ambiguous boyfriend, gave me life ([spoiler]and possibly a villain origin story[/spoiler]). im occasionally being the worst person in hogwarts. the graphics are stunning, the gameplay is addictive, and the moral choices? lets just say my dark witch arc came naturally [b]11/10[/b] avada kedavra gg

घोंघे खाओ !! मगलू की औलाद

I said this once get that junk off the menu of hogwarts ...Having all kind of problems  Quidditch  it lags the game way to much. With out it game plays just fine stop trying to cram it up there it's not going to work....

Fun game cool stories and world building. Excited to see what they improve on for the second one.

Fun game but its a one time play through. The devs aren't too game savvy. They don't have new game plus or any end game content at all. Love harry potter, and my first play through was great but not worth the price given its a one time shot. Honestly was pretty disappointed and i'm lvl 38 and almost 100% the game. The bulk of the side missions are puzzles and very similar to each other as well so they get old fast.  I am trying not to use harsh wording but lets just say.. extremely disappointed with this game, given all the hype

As a diehard Potterhead when I was a child, this is almost the exact game that I had hoped to come to fruition. While the spellcasting mechanics and other lore-accurate things were lacking, the game made up for it with an expansive map, reasonable combat mechanics that don't make the game too easy to enjoy.

I still have a long way to go before I complete the game and truly discover everything good and bad about this game, but I daresay this is a good starting point for any future aspiring Harry Potter game creators.

pretty good.

A labor of love. I love it. It's worth its price.

fun

There are so many things to do!  You can personalize your witch/wizard, the main game also has a LOT of side quests.  I've been playing for 12 hours so far and it says I'm only 10% done with the game, so there is so much to explore.  Wand duels are really fun and riding on the brooms is awesome!  Fun game.  Would definitely recommend, especially if you're a HP fan.

A great adventure game. And even more so if youre a fan of the Harry Potter Universe. Story and gameplay are fantastic! There are some loss of frame rates when in the school or in town, but it doesnt last too long. Other than that, its a great game to play and to lose yourself into. 9/10.

 A resplendent tapestry of interactive storytelling, Hogwarts Legacy masterfully captures the ineffable charm and arcane allure of the wizarding world. Its intricately woven narrative, paired with an expansively detailed open-world environment, provides an unparalleled odyssey of discovery and spellbinding adventure. The meticulous attention to detail, from the architectural grandeur of Hogwarts to the lush landscapes beyond, exemplifies a prodigious dedication to world-building. Engaging mechanics, robust customization options, and an evocative score elevate the experience to a truly transcendent realm of gaming artistry

Constantly crashes cannot even make it 10 minutes into the game.

game pretty spells fast secrets fun

fun game

This Game was extremely fun.  I'm not a Die Hard Harry Potter Fan, but know the movies, and getting to dive into that world was satisfying, fun, and a hell of a ride.

Finished the main story, I'm probably not going to do another playthrough, but I enjoyed the story and the feel of combat and exploration in this game. Not a harry potter fan really but enjoyed the game enough to play it out. Had some graphics issues (mainly water rendering improperly) on an older system. While it's true that enemies level scaling alongside you can make progression after a certain point feel less rewarding, combat later in the game becomes so easy because of the talent point system. This game has a surprising amount of content but wouldn't take too long to 100% (if willing to use guides - much involves finding things), though I have no desire to.

Definitely wouldn't pay full price but probably worth a consideration at sale price. Enjoyed playing this game, if you think you might enjoy it, you probably will. It is very approachable but if you play a lot of stuff like this maybe consider turning difficulty up because I thought it was pretty easy.

Very fun! Can't wait for more content or another story! Great, game with hours of fun, love it.

Yes

[h1] General Thoughts[/h1]
Hogwarts Legacy has a decent story and good Harry Potter Universe lore. It truly feels like you're experiencing a story that happened in the Hogwarts castle about a century before the HP movies and books. Anybody that enjoys the series and doesn't mind some combat will have a blast with this game.

The combat in this game is pretty good and at times can feel almost souls-like. Lots of dodging and ability use during fights, but this opens up opportunities for combos which can be fun. Sometimes I find myself also wanting a melee option in a fight.

The broom flight can be clunky on a PC with mouse/keyboard controls. I have swapped to a controller during the broom trials and found a significant increase of control on the broom.

I have a while to go in this game. This review might get updated once I finish if I have any additional thoughts.

[h1] Objective Pro/Con[/h1]
[h2]Pros[/h2]
- Good performance for a game of its size. Running the game at ultra settings without ray tracing is great.

- This game helps generate a fantastic understanding of the Hogwarts castle layout for those that struggle with following it via the description in the books or the views from the movies. I'd almost recommend this game based on this alone.

[h2]Cons[/h2]
- Ray tracing is a serious tax and improves the lighting in the game an unjustifiable amount for the performance penalty.

- Game can sometimes be prone to crashing and spacial bugs that cause the player to get stuck in the falling animation. It generally autosaves frequently enough that this isn't that big of a deal.

Very good!

A Classic Long Game

great

Advantages:
1. Amazing Hogwarts and nearby territories detailing.
2. Exciting combat system.
3. Well-done graphics and performance.

Disadvantages:
1. A little boring side-activities.
2. No Quidditch.

I can not explain it but I am 2 hours in and do not know if i can finish it. The game feels soulless and like it was created with AI. Overall kinda boring. Huge let down.

no sex :(

amazing game all around

I was enjoying it, but as I was playing contemplating if i could free the house elves (they are just blatantly slaves after all). Then they gave me a slave and i was very conflicted. Haven't played since.

Amazing

fun so far

fun especially for harry potter fans


I like the game. I'm not liking the ads when I boot up.

Grabbed a broom, flex into a spider web, was eaten by spider clan 10/10

Great game for HP addicts. Combat and scenery is probably the best thing about it and everything else is kinda mid.

yes

/

One of the best games I've played in a very long time. Highly recommended

Open world quests.

Childhood dream come true and so much more. Really just an honestly good game!

gg laa

good


i cast spells. i am wizard now

I loved this game. Exploration and adventure are it's strong suits. I 100 % this game without really trying just having fun exploring around. Combat isn't challenging, but it's interesting enough to not be annoying or unfun. Visuals are amazing, performance has come a long way since release. Sound design is rather good though nothing standout. There's plenty of mods available to fix every complaint I have with the game. I'd like to see the game implement a way to play house exclusive missions without starting a new save as something to do at endgame, but perhaps that will be a mod as well. I can't reccomend the game because of the controversy surrounding it, but if you're looking to buy anyways I can say you'll more than enjoy the game itself.

Got jumpscared by spiders everytime they appeared, awesome sauce game! 🔥

.

WOW!!!!

If I wanted to be gay I would just be gay. I don't need it shoved down my throat. No pun intended, but you better expect it. Disgusting. 2025 will be the year where common sense will regain it's reign.

Game is beautiful even on low graphics, amazing story, even with entirely different characters and the new ancient magic thing (which at first i thought was going to be terrible) it was still amazing.

Fantastic game but I hate the performance, lots of stuttering issues which affects me when playing the game apart from that it's a really good game. Pls fix the stuttering issues optimize it better

I think this is well made game with great graphics loads of quests items and spells, the only real issue I have with the game is the number of spell slots is too small and a bit of a struggle to map them in combat as you cant get them all. 
If your a fan of Harry Potter you'll enjoy this game

IT IS FUN

Absolutely loved, brought out the inner child in me and made me remember why I originally fell in love with the Harry Potter world.

GOOD

love it

Amazing game, so fun and interactive. Love it!!!!

Loving Hogwarts! Seen it streamed on twitch and it looked hella fun, so when steam had it on sale I had to scoop it up! So glad I did too! I've been loving every bit of the game from graphics to gameplay and mechanics. Only thing I would want added would be the option to play with friends. 10/10 recommend

Startup was a bit slow but it's a good way to get a good feel for this game.
I like it very much and game progression seems spot on.
For the negative reviewers out there, just focus on whats positive for a change will you.
It's so easy to find something negative whilst the game looks very polished imho.

I give the game a solid thumbs up!! Great Job!

wow, many color in dis gem big castle big wand boom boom wow!

twas good

Very interesting story and gameplay

Pros:
- Open world, with tons of content and side quests
- lack of DEI garbage, finally

Cons:
- sometimes, very seldom, simulated cloth gets stuck into the character, causing FPS drops.

Really bland and repetitive gameplay. Good graphics with bad performance.

If you are Harry Potter fan, OK game. If not, it's a Ubisoft style game with mindless filler quests.

love melting peoples minds

I enjoyed playing Hogwarts Legacy, though many of the aspects are repetitive. The quests, dungeons, Merlin Trials, all feel the same after a while and it gets grindy if you want to 100% the game. That fact set aside, if you grew up with Harry Potter like I did, the game is a fun bit of nostalgia and is easy to enjoy. There is much of the Harry Potter universe that isn't explored which leaves hopes for an improved second installation. 
I would recommend picking this game up if it's under $20!

Despite the bland story, this is by far one of the most interesting game i have ever played. Relive my childhood imagination alot

good

THIS GAME IS FUCKING AMAZING

Great breadth, not much depth. I think this is the best way to describe this game. 

Game mechanics are good and the world is big and I personally found fun to explore (especially the castle itself). My main criticism is that they should have made the world a little smaller and focused that time on more characters and interesting quests. That's not to say there [i]aren't[/i] good quests in the game - there [i]are[/i] - it's just that there aren't enough of them. 

Basically, I wouldn't get the game at full price - at the time of my review it's on a 75% sale which I [i]absolutely[/i] think is worth it, and at 50% sale I still think it's worth getting, but not at full price. I do hope they make another one of these and will have the time and resources to focus on some depth - I personally think the actual layout and design of the world is already perfect, it just needs to be populated a little more.

It's a shallow movieset, not a game. Visually stunning, but no depth. Open world is dull and monotonous. Hogwarts is lifeless and empty. No NPC interactions, no heat for casting unforgiveable curses, no classes, no immersion, you're a visitor in a movie set of Hogwarts. A disneyland tour of sorts. Nothing particularly innovative gameplay-wise either. Without the Harry Potter label, this is just another generic open world RPG.

[b] Only reason this game is this successful is because there are no other modern Harry Potter games. If EA or Ubisoft released this, it would be the subject of 100s of videos on Youtube about everything wrong with the modern gaming industry. [/b]

Not very far in the game right now, but I have to say, Fuck this game. I start the game, ready to play, and an ad for Lego pops up. I don't care about your harry potter Lego. It's a 20+ year old franchise. I know you have Lego somewhere, if I care I'll buy some. The most offensive thing is that I paid for the game, and you're advertising to me as if it's a free-to-play jam. Stop it. Treat your paying customers like paying customers.

It's not the best or most polished game out there, but it delivers fun for what it is — enjoyable mediocrity. 6.8/10.

Минув майже рік відтоді, як Hogwarts Legacy вийшла на ПК. Її реліз супроводжувався численними багами, глічами, низькою частотою кадрів тощо. Через це я вирішив не купувати гру одразу.

Я сподівався, що з часом ситуація покращиться. Моє очікування тривало цілий рік, але, як виявилося, марно.

На моєму комп’ютері, який, хоч і не є топовою high-end конфігурацією, все ж входить у цю категорію, гра чудово працювала на 100-120 кадрах на ультра-налаштуваннях. Однак усе змінилося, коли я дістався самого Гоґвардса. Регулярні падіння FPS до 30 кадрів під час використання закляття Revelio стали нестерпними. Просідання FPS при відвідуванні нових локацій також залишають неприємне враження.

"Дякую" розробникам за “чудову” оптимізацію, яка повністю руйнує враження від гри.

Dont get me wrong I loved this f game, all the quests and sidequest its really fun in my opinion. But I put in like 18 hours and all my progress is gone, the files are in my computer but there is no way to run them which is weird. It randomly just happened too, I just saved the game and closed it as I normally do. This time it restarted everything and I have to replay....MAKE A BACK UP

The game runs out of memory on DDR4 16GB, I will upgrade my RAM to 32GB but I am disappointed as it says Minimum and recommended is 16GB. So I am unable to give a proper review as of now.

As much as I wanted to enjoy this game, I found it massively disappointing. The "mystery" of exploring the open world is really quickly gone when you can just hop on a broomstick and fly in a straight line to whichever POI you want. The puzzles are tedious and lack creativity, I was often shocked by how puzzles were simply "brute forced" and required no tact.

The immersion is mediocre, especially once you learn the Unforgiveable curses - kinda hard to LARP when you (a teenage Hogwarts student) can just sling Crucio around on a whim. It feels like there are no real consequences for any of your actions, which makes the game much less enjoyable.

The combat itself can be fun and entertaining, and there's a solid (but unspectacular) array of spells for you to play around with - OR you could just smack everyone with a killing curse and call it a day.

I rarely find an RPG this disappointing, I'm usually very easily satisfied by games. Some of the disappointment probably comes from a love for the books/movies, but definitely not all. Overall it's an okay game to get on sale - if there's nothing else you're remotely interested in playing.

This Game is good but this NEED SOME PROPER FIX FOR FPS STUTTERING I Have RTX 4070 Super I'm Getting 150+ FPS but the stuttering is a lot i mean a lot every second GPU usage is drop with that FPS Drops as well. Developer please stop trying to make games and selling them if u can't even fix the main issue it's been "1Year" since this game is released and still they haven't fixed it yet, I mean come on Dev how could u sell this game if u can't even listed to the players Problem. Please don't buy this game if your looking for better game with best performance even if u have high end pc it will still run like crap.


I wish there was an option to give a neutral review. I'd give this about a 6/10, but I can't recommend it.

Zero depth in the story, combat is repetitive and frustrating, characters are bland. It feels like you're playing the game equivalent of a rollercoaster.

If you're a massive Harry Potter fan and not much of a gamer, you'll probably love it.

I see I have a lot of time in this game. I don't know how it happened, it's super boring. There's a very nice environment to find some neat stuff for you to look at (well, mostly the castle), but eventually you realize that is the only thing of value here. In defense of my playtime, for a long time it feels like a great tutorial section that keeps unlocking new shiny stuff that you don't yet realize will not add to complexity, it's a decent trick. It kept me going, and going, and when I realized it would add up into being an actual game, I did some sunk cost thinking and finished it anyway.

I guess I'm just too old for this one. Go figure, the Harry Potter game is literally made for children. Nothing wrong with that. I just don't get what other (adult) people see in it.

Even though, it's a negatvie review the game itself isn't that bad, it's for sure fun to play for a Harry Potter fan, the world is beautiful and I wish it was enough to call this game good.


Open World - 7/10 (it's beautiful, but not very lively nonetheless)
Fighting - 7/10 (it's fun at least)
Storyline - 2/10 (no comment)
Quests - 2/10 (generic)
Dialogs - 2/10 (sound like GPT 2.0 outputs)
Characters - 2/10 (boring)

For such an open world map with beautiful sceneries there could be more interesting or engaging quests / findings / easter eggs etc. Other than that I just felt like watching a new Netflix movies - the looks are okay, but it's sh*t if you dive deeper. 

Disclosure: I played the game for free, but it's surely not worth the price unless you're a potter-maniac.

It's just boring. Could have been great but a few hours in and you're basically bored. Mundane fetch quests, more fetch quests, and same stuff over and over. Don't buy it. Save your money.

i loved the graphics, loved all the spells, loved the mounts, loved the exploring. the combat was okay, but the STORY... as someone who likes a good story i cannot recommend this game. but if you are just a fan of the hp universe and just wanna explore then i can recommend this game!

I decided to 100% this game, which was a brutal mistake. Not because it was hard, but because it was repetitive, underwhelming, and lazily constructed. The first third of the game was at least somewhat interesting due to still finding new things to do and learn. After that though it was just a constant regurgitation of activities you've already completed. If you are wondering if you should finally give this game a chance, and for some reason see my review.. I say go ahead, buy it on sale, enjoy the magic for about 25 hours and then never look back. Knowing that you are missing nothing

Consistently crashes at startup. I haven't been able to play it. I've tried many other online hints, such as removing the games directory and it still crashes. I have the latest nvidia drivers and 128GB of ram on win11. Not recommended.

Possibly the greatest thing that fans could’ve wanted out of a Harry Potter Game. You are the main character, you make your own decisions. In this case your Harry Potter but without all the Voldemort stuff. Excessively interesting, action packed and addictive. A must buy for any Harry Potter fan or just someone who wants to get into the franchise. Only thing is sometimes it glitches and the graphics are a little off but other than that, you should have an amazing and wonderful time.

Great game, really well made. Wish there was a similar game with lord of the rings.

Pros: Amazing world, fun combat, great exploration activities. 
Cons: Lack of dialogue choices, story inconsistency, pacing (ending felt rushed). 
8/10

in genral it has an amazing plot and it has so many details. i really recommend it for newbies.

If you're a fan of harry potter and it's franchises; Play it. Period.

this game has an incredible level of attention to detail and works hard to immerse you in the hogwarts school roleplay. 

There is an incredible amount of sidecontent; most of it is boiled down to fetch quests and spell puzzles- though i find these interactions to at least be thoughtful and well produced- many of the social dynamics are interesting and with decent voice acting I at least enjoy seeing the games narratives unfold. Some of the side-content is admittedly exacerbating (Merlin trials, flying keys, alohomora gating nonsense, etc etc); I think that at least there will be likely some of these activities that you will find interesting; and you don't have to feel like you're missing much if you'd prefer to give them a pass. 

the facial animations can be a bit uncanny; but the raw creativity and thoughtfulness that went into this game puts it as one of my top played games in quite some time- to my surprise ( I did not think I would like this game at all; and i came in with bitter thoughts about all of the Author's antisocial views- ready to hate).

Good Story, could you use some more interesting side quests but that may just be a personal note. Overall very happy with the purchase.

The game is interesting at the beginning, although, after 16 hours, I can fairly say that I have no motivation to continue playing, this might be due to the fact that I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but to be honest, the game got hella boring and I cannot find the motivation to finish it. 

The story is not that interesting to me, the gameplay/combat was fun at first, but also gets very repetitive.


Other than that, roaming, and the world around feels nice.


It's a recommended - with caveats. One is that if you're not already a fan of Harry Potter I'd say it's definitely not recommented as the charm relies heavily on nostalgia.

This game is a good entry into gaming itself - it was very much designed with a tutorial and playstyle aimed to slowly acclimatise people who may have never played games before (so if you are a fan of the franchise and not gaming - it's designed for you, you'll be fine!). As a consequence if you had played many games before it can feel quite slow to start. Combat is still quite fun though and the gradual unlock of spells keeps some variety in it.

This is offest by this game's strongest point - environments. Hogwarts castle especially. The castle is crafted with love, detailed, lore accurate. You can essentially play out your fantasy of being a wziard and run around the castle. Let's face it, this is the entire reason this game was made.

The game has issues, sure. Mainly, majority of it requires you to spend time in surrounding Highlands. I love myself some scottish highlands, but quite frankly spending hours within the hills is not why I bought a game about a magic castle. The world is vast and extremely repetative and if you are a completionist you will be doing a few dozen of virtually identical puzzles.

Plot wise - decent, but written for slightly younger audience, as advertised - bit uneven in quality, but honestly I was pleasantly surpised. If you want to heavily RP, be prepared to do the heavylifting in your brain. Yeah, I wouldn't say it's a great story but it was solid and throughly enjoyable.

tldr - if you would like to explore Hogwarts, go for it.

I have always been a Harry Potter fan for as long as i remember. this game has so much story and life. it feels like you are actually in the game 1000000% recommend !!!!!!!! If you are thinking about getting it GET IT!!!!!

It's a great world, and the first few hours feel very magical.
Then all the gameplay turns into either simple puzzles or fighting from room to room. The loot system is also really bad. The story was not worth sitting through all that dialogue. Good, but not great. 6/10

Overall fun, especially combat.

Game is easy to beat even on hard, story line mediocre, side quests were more fun. Repetitive events

Encountered game breaking bugs, had to reload a few times.

It nails the atmosphere, and remains engaging throughout the main story. If you try and do all the side quests, you might get burned out, so I recommend doing some side quests but not all. Combat is fun, but can get stale after a while, but you can always switch up your spells to make it a little different. Good voice acting, good graphics, very stable, and no bugs at all during my play through.

Off to a bad start.. not even in the game yet.
At this point, the game is almost 2 years old so I'm not expecting technical glitches at start.

So there is the obnoxiously long disclaimer about epileptic seizures, great.
Next, loading of shaders for several minutes.
Then you get yelled at by some menu reading accessibility option, then do a graphics test.
So the system sets the levels and RTX is off, ok, let's try it.
Then you claim 20 rewards one by one.
And theeeen, the letter from Hogwarts appears, and the game crashes like Hagrid on a motorbike.
Sure, let's try again: this time, same experience. All in all, half an hour to crash twice, in the same way, in the same place.
I do want to play this game though, so not doing a refund. But this is abysmal.
Gonna try next to dumb down the graphics and see where that takes me - RTX 2080Ti so not the latest, not the greatest, but I would expect it to run with RTX off...

I can't in good conscious recommend this game in it's current state. When I bought the game it ran great and was able to complete the story a few times. However, like many people I've started to experience massive FPS drops with no real way of permanently fixing it. So, until the issue is resolved my review stays negative.

I really liked this game. This is the first time I play this genre, and being a fan of harry potter helped me keep going. At first I thought I would find the controls overwhelming, but it was very friendly. I loved how much I could explore the castle and surrounding areas and riding a broom was very fun. The side quest were great too. On another note, the cut scenes were way too long and boring, I felt there were too many characters and the side quest felt a little more interesting than the main quest. I liked how you could make certain choices, but having no real consequences from your decisions made it kinda pointless. Also, the character creation could use a lot more customization. Overall, I would recommend it for a fair price.

[h1] Plus:  [/h1]

- It's Harry Potter

- Stunning graphics, but unfortunately to avoid overheating/ obtainable FPS, I had my RTX2060 SUPER all at medium settings, other than those obvious FPS killer settings. Here are 2 videos that I used to obtain affordable FPS for this graphic intensive game if you ever have a more than 5 years old GPU card:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrMSn125PY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0mWVLhy954&t=354s

- To 100% achievement like I did over here, it's really not too bad, seriously. They do not have a 'Complete game with X difficulty'. It's really, doable. They do have things to collect, but its doable with plenty of guides online. 

- Side mission or main mission are more fun? To me, it's both. Character arcs and storyline + plot, it's really good. 

- Combat system, in my opinion, could be improved, parry system relies on the slow mo timer sorts and it's like super easy, like way too easy. You can also consider that the combat system is somewhat a hack and slash type of puddle. 

- Character power: now, many would argue, there's the easy path and there's the other path. Easy path would be using those dark arts powers while the other path involve using other skills. To me, character power on this game depends on how you wanna approach it, whether via using plants to fight / using complete stealth / potions. There's no right or wrong, I wanna 100% the game so using dark arts is the quickest solution to 1 tap kill enemies. However, if you would wanna try say, a combination of potion + plants, go ahead and try, no harm no foul. Again, there's also the element of the 'Ancient magic power', which is also OP in my opinion, but necessary, it's not as super OP as Avra Kadavra and it relies on your attacks on enemies and you have to collect the 'magic power'.

- Story is pretty linear, which I'm neutral towards. Puzzles in the game are also quite fun and challenging


[h1] Minus:  [/h1]

- No nudity

- Aside from the obvious GPU intensive answer, there's also the element of the storage. Well, typically for single player mode games, my RTX2060 SUPER + WD Black 2TB wouldn't struggle, but for this case this game eats up my hard disk. I honestly don't think WD Black is that sucks, but this game made it look like a kid. The saving time, loading time, cloud syncing time, is like total crap when you are using a hard disk instead of SSD to play this game. I honestly think that my PC suffered from BIOS/ startup issues just because I restarted my PC during when the game is downloading/ patching/ syncing

- To grind for the achievement for those map collectibles are pretty boring, but there's no other choice, it's considerably easier to 100% this game compared to others that I have played in the past.

- Bugs and crashes: yes I do sometimes encounter this and I do not think it has anything to do with my GPU / heating/ CPU, it could be the storage issues but I would think that this game do suffer from some optimization if you are coming from older cards

- They did not have the time nor budget to add in a Quidditch game

- As said above, this game needs SSD, don't know why but it needs it else suffer stuttering. Even I could run GTA 5 from HDD with minimal stutter during loadings

- You have a skill called 'Revelio' which essentially is a 'Detective mode' and in my opinion, is necessary for the game, but it's mundane. I honestly wished they could have replaced or add on some other functions to act as a proxy for this Detective mode skill.

Great story
Great game play
Though I hope there are more kinds of AoE attack/defense

This is like Harry Potter-themed Skyrim... and I mean that in the best way! The world is so large and dense, but it has a fun main story to ground it! While I'm not exactly sure yet on the timeline this game takes place in comparison to when Harry Potter occurred, it provides some cool expansion on the Wizarding World lore and it has characters that adjacently relate to the ones we know from Harry Potter. 

The gameplay is fun, providing a ton of varied kinds of things to do from flying, to potions, to herbology, to obviously spellcraft, and a way to master all of them to be the best possible player. 

You can tell the developers have a lot of love for the Wizarding World, they put a lot of thought and care into this game!

Awesome game to relive the whole Harry Potter World. Even if you are not a fan of the wizarding world or do not know about it, this is still a game worth trying. I have played this game 2 times and still intend to play for the 3rd and 4th time at least.

Meeeh,
I went through the main almost all of the side quests of the game. It's a fun experience at first but gets very boring up to a point were you abrakadabra every enemy and still it's boring.


Amazing game. Harry Potter fans will love this product. Magic is too powerful but don't get on the dark side.

[h1]MERLIN'S BEARD![/h1]

I've been completely enchanted by [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i]. The game captures the magic of the wizarding world perfectly, with stunning visuals and an immersive storyline. I've spent countless hours exploring the open world, casting spells and uncovering secrets. It's a must-play for any Harry Potter fan out there. Simply put, it's spellbinding!

[b][10/10][/b]

tried playing it end of 2024 and around the halfway point it started crashing enough to make it too annoying to keep playing. Never had problems with crashes like this on many more demanding games.

The game is bland, I can't help but get bored. I'd rather play some other game eventhough I'm a potterhead.

What a spectacular game! However, it would be great if the next game would be in the timeline of Harry Potter and other main characters on J.K Rowlings HP series.

Look, the game is well made. The voice acting, animations, graphics, optimization, etc: Great! But to be completely honest, your only going to enjoy this game if you're a hardcore hairy potter fan. Most of the game is just being able to experience the harry potter world in a video game, and most of the aspects, goals, challenges in the game are pretty much just given to you without a sweat. Doesn't ruin the game, but I'm one of those people who don't really fit that puzzle slot.

TLDR: Well made, but not challenging. You'll love it if you're a harry potter fan and if you like simple games to chill and play around with.

5/10, personally wouldn't recommend.

Bought this in the sale and was surprised how bad the performance still is after all of this time. Mods can only do so much.

Was fantastic at launch, but doesn't boot at all now that I've reinstalled and wanted to do another playthrough.
I'd refund it if I could.

A very fun game with puzzles. NPCs aren't very realistic but I understand. Mods make the game a lot better. I recommend the Ascendio III mod which instead uses FSR 3 when you have DLSS enabled.  For my 3060ti running 1440p, it is best to use DLSS quality(alongside this mod), have Reflex Low Latency enabled(NOT boost), enable VSync, and have all graphics set to medium except material and texture, set those to high. Raytracing off.  Undervolt with MSI Afterburner and use RivaTuner to limit FPS. If you use the in game FPS limiter you will have stuttering.  All of this gets me a smooth 60fps.  I also recommend the minimap enhance mod that makes the minimap less blocky.  The mouse broom control mod (by r457) and skip alohomora mod (by icouldifiwantedto) are nice touches.  Don't make the same mistake as me and buy the base game only on g2a. Now I would have to spend 15 dollars to upgrade.  Get the deluxe version to begin with on g2a, it's only $4 more in case you enjoy it.

crash > preparing shaders... > play for 10 minutes.

rinse and repeat.

Love the game, it's amazing. 

But I booted it up today and got a full screen ad on the main menu.

Nah dude that ain't it.

Game no longer works for me (I have a 4090), crashes with a video memory issue that many others have seen (can't load rendering resource) - reinstall, reinstall of video drivers, playing with OS settings - nothing works. All other games work but this one. Avoid this game.

I bought this game full price sadly but this game is a must NOT buy it has a very slow and boring movement system and a small amount of very lackluster spells if you have the money for this game just buy elden ring and get 20x the amount of spells and mabye actually have some fun.

Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive open-world RPG that brings the Wizarding World to life. Set in the 1800s, it lets players craft their own magical story within the halls of Hogwarts and beyond.

Highlights:

Stunning world-building with detailed locations like Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the Forbidden Forest.
Intuitive combat system featuring spells, potions, and duels.
Extensive customization options and engaging side quests.
Drawbacks:

Occasional technical glitches and frame rate drops.
Some repetitive tasks.
Verdict: A dream come true for Harry Potter fans, Hogwarts Legacy delivers an enchanting experience, blending exploration, combat, and storytelling. Despite minor flaws, it’s a must-play for fans and RPG lovers.

Not just a fly by night cash grab type game about a popular intellectual property.  It feels like a labor of love.  Highly recommend!

What a beautiful experience this game provides! To see Hogwarts in every aspect is to come back to the movies and explore the parts you didn't see on the screen.
The gameplay is amazing, learning spells, going to classes and into some dangerous adventures.
An open world game but very intuitive, and the best part, to customize your character's clothes and your own room of requirement!
10/10 - Must play for fans of the saga!

Hogwarts Legacy lets you live the dream of being a student at Hogwarts, with cool magic and a big world to explore. The game looks amazing, and the story is fun, with lots of adventures.

But some parts can feel a bit repetitive, and the combat is sometimes tricky. It’s a great game for Harry Potter fans, but it’s not perfect.

I'd have it refunded it, but I tried getting it to work for long enough that I can't get it refunded now. I'm on Linux  with an AMD card and cpu. From what I read, it's bad on windows too, just a heads up.

DO NOT BUY. there is currently a game breaking softlock about 4 hours into the game that CAN NOT BE FIXED that was introduced in the games patch back in MAY 8 2024. the game is soft lock across all new characters that HAVE NOT pass the first trial.

Even though i have 200+ hours on this game, i feel the need to make a negative review which it deserves.
The game came out 2 years ago, and they did not release a single good optimization update, patch, or anything in that matter to fix the terrible optimization for PC. 
i like the game itself, it has beautiful views and vibes, however - the unoptimization is too much.


Fun world exploration. Sometimes it feels like a part time job doing these tasks but it's still fun.

Can't opt out of your data being sold because it takes you to a website that is unavailable outside of US.

Only god thing is the harry potter universe. Storyline is boring, characters underdeveloped and uninteresting. so disappointed most of the castles doesn't reasemble the ones in the movies.

Mid game.
I was more interested in Sebastian’s side quest story line than the main game. There’s not a lot of enemy variety. Spell combinations are too basic. Open world feels lively for the most part, exploration is okay. Hogwarts castle, interior and environments are really well crafted. Combat felt so repetitive around late game. Final boss battle was horrible. Not worth at all it you aren’t a fan of Harry Potter universe.

what a brilliant way to explore this world beyond Harry Potter honestly i havent played much on pc and did my playthrough on ps5 and i gotta say the game is game of the year quality and when theres a number 2 you can bet ill  be there on launch day.

for the most part you can choose to play stealthy or just full on combat decent character customisation the world is a decent size its not a game where you have to grind all the time but it doesnt just han you everything which is great and to top it all off the visuals are beautiful, the music nostalgic well done

Good game if your a fan of Harry Potter.
Can get a bit repetitive with the collections, but doesn't take too long so remains enjoyable

This game took me back to my childhood memories of the Harry Potter world. The graphics are awesome, and I never imagined I would get the chance to explore and roam inside Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience the magical world of Harry Potter.

I didn't think i would like this game, but i love it.
I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, haven't read the books and the movies are ok.
But it was on sale and i thought i have a go, and i'm pleasantly surprised.
It has the same feel as the first Fable game, which is my #1 game of all times.

10/10 would recommend, even if you aren't a big H.P fan

It's a Good game for me.
The game itself is pretty enjoyable, even you aren't a fan of Harry Potter.
There are a lot of stuff to do and explore.

But if you looking for  something that can be grind and play forever, this is not the game for you.
After Ten-ish hour into the game. All of the content seem to get repetitive.

Every combat is just the same, you just change the effect of your spell.
Most of your Challenger is just more bullet sponge than the last.
Since the combat system is not so up there. 
When its come to Quest... Both Main and Side Quest only driven by the Lore.
And... it's was just Ok-ish.

Exploring the World of the game is just travel to the right place at the right time... with a right tool.
After you engage with one the rest is pretty much the same. rarely will give you a challenged.

awesome game so far! beautiful graphics and immense story-line! Be prepared for longer video sequences but otherwise i love it.

Great game graphics are amazing on 4070 Super

i love it so much, the graphics quality is beautiful and as a big fan of Harry Potter i am so happy to walk around Howarts!!

the story is great. but you will need some mods to fix the bugs that never got fixed. for example, in the first trial when you defeat the boss he is supposed to drop a tear for a pensive that you look into later. well, more often than not, he doesn't. there is a mod to fix that

Just beat the main story for the 2nd time .  first on switch,  now on PC.  I had a blast beating it in 43 hours.  gonna be a while before I get 100% again like I did on switch far after beating the main story.  Hufflepuff this time.  lots of plant warfare.  Super fun

Hogwarts Legacy is one of those games that only compare to other games! This is an absolute blast to play, or should I say experience. Well done with all of the attributes offered in this game. When I played the scene in the dark and light was the only answer, I knew, at that point that I could see why this game is so spectacular!! I would recommend this game to anyone.

I have never been one for the Harry Potter books or films but I bought this game as the open world element of wizards and witches intrigued me. Safe to say It’s a great game as I have 100% it now and would highly suggest anyone grabs it especially when it’s on sale.

Most of my time with the game has been in handheld mode on the Steam Deck and found it to be a flawless experience.

Overall this game is fantastic, it has good storyline, combats, side quest, and  secrets and puzzles.


Fun game to play especially if your introducing people to the world of hogwarts! really enjoying it so far! the story has reminded me of the books which is a pleasant surprise!
