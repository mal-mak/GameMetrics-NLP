Buggy. Fairly commonly, trying to make substitutions in the middle of a game, the game decides to hardlock you. You cannot make substitutions, you cannot exit the game, you cannot exit the sub screen. ALT F4 is the only option then.

Every game also you have 4-5 occasions of the game shitting itself, the FPS dropping to sub-10 for a few seconds, and then going back to normal. Windows also does not recognise it as a game, you have to add it manually, otherwise the FPS normally is below 20.

i dont like it. they dont want to refund


Buggy mess, serious UI issues. Only worth buying if game is at least 60% off.

Bok

Meh

 Майка ви да умре на всичките които сте я създатли тази шибана игра


if you care for your mental health, do not buy this game.

ever tried scoring with a header in this game? yeah dont bother

Cool but fix the goddamn stuttering in rush gamemode

yea yea

Football

Not recomended. Fuck you EA with your fuckind defence system!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At this point the game just gets sold because of its name , because the gameplay is horrible . Whenever we start a match the lag starts and its impossible to play in that lag . EA must fix these issues .

Good game, a  bit easy to get good got a 91 rated after 2 hours of ultimate team

Stutter city, unaffected by changing in graphics settings. Looking online this was caused by an anticheat system which has tanked performance and ruined it for players who can no longer get refunds - what a joke.

FC 24 is still better

FC 25 is an incredibly frustrating and deeply disappointing game that feels more like a psychological trap than a source of entertainment. Despite its hefty price tag, it delivers subpar content and a gameplay loop designed to exploit players’ sense of commitment, a phenomenon often referred to as the sunk cost fallacy.

This concept, well-documented in behavioral psychology, describes how individuals continue investing time or money into something they feel they’ve already committed to, even when it no longer provides value. FC 25 leverages this effect, encouraging players to persist despite the overwhelmingly negative experience.

While the game might occasionally feel tolerable, most sessions end in frustration, anger, and emotional distress. This cycle of stress not only undermines the game’s entertainment value but poses a potential risk to players’ mental well-being. For a title with such a significant price point, FC 25 fails to deliver a positive or rewarding experience and instead fosters harmful patterns of behavior.  DO NOT BUY.

Never disliked this franchise this much. Did not expect such a downgrade. Extremely disappointing.

The defensive movement of players are so bad compared to the previous version (FC 24). It's also more fragile to through pass from the opposition, so we can concede the goal easier than before. Fix it up!

!!!!

Excellent!

No worthwhile SBCS or Promos, the ball will sometimes go 100000 miles per hour for no random reason and score in your net, game freezes constantly needing you to restart the game, same mechanics from last year, glitched packs, random white diamonds on your squad and sbc profile making you restart once again, the most boring opening animations in the last 15 EA games, worse animatons than FIFA 16. I love fifa but what the fuck is this absolute horseshit of a game riddled with bugs and glitches, unrealistic animations that never get fucking fixed because EA developers are too busy trying to fuck new ways of making micro transactions for kids. Overall not the worse EA game.

Game was playing well with locked 60fps. After a few games it became a stuttering mess!!! FPS all over the place. 48fps and above all over the place. Have seen a forum where this is discussed. Won't be buying another EA fc game again. Pathetic work from ea, they appear to have not resolved this issue for a while!!!!

Ultimate is literally impossible to play for anyone that is late to the game. You can't get access to the transfer market without playing 12+ hours of game play. Once you've completed the tasks to get access, you need to wait a further 24 hours. By this point I'm reminded why I haven't played fifa for 3 years.

relly cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.............l.

ass

my team management always bugging when playing manager career

I wish my friends would play wit me

game is really good 


Good game

worst game ever this game is the worst soccer game i ever played in a long time

Just like every other year, EA managed to put out a subpar game with a ton of glitches that isn't enjoyable for anyone who doesn't like wasting money on card gambling.

yo ea, not everyone that bought this game wants to play ultimate team or ur fucking dogshit online playing, probably they only wanted to play career. And guess what... ur career is dog ass shit bird, with a lot of shit ass bugs like i cant even sprint my player... yo bitch sprinting is the basic shit in football. Please hear your community and fix this bugs.

Quick cash grab for EA. First of all on PC everything is blurry graphics looks like a 2010's pixelated game, even after tweaking the settings FIFA 21, still looks, and performs better. Save your money and buy something else.

The reason why I am still playing is not liking this game but loving football. Unfortunately, we don't have perfect football game this moment. But FC series is truly getting far away from football itself. I haven't felt happy and satisfied when playing FC/FIFA for a long time. And it is getting worse.

I do not recommend it! With each patch, the game becomes more and more dependent on the connection. FC IQ totally sucks, the old tactic setting option was much more thoughtful and the AI worked as it should. Impact lag is present in every match. The menu is not optimized, there are a lot of freezes. In the UT Mode, namely SBC, the R1 and L1 buttons are broken. The players are constantly offside. Added a lot of unnecessary animations on the players. When players press certain buttons, they perform something unintended. Alas, this is the most lame part in the history of football simulator!!!!!

Ass game

Amazing!

no improvement

don't buy this trash save your money.

too many bugs

fc24 was better

id love to see developers kids suicide cases because they played eafc rn tbh

bad game

bitch ass game crashes every hour of playtime

great game! (I'am 70 and don't have much longer and this will likely be my final video game ever. So I want to teach some of the youngins about life. be racist.)

Shit game, EA somehow manages to make this game worse and worse every year.

Fuck EA the gay fucks

This game is absolutely horrendous. So many bugs in career mode its not even playable. Worst iteration of fc/fifa till date

i

very fun

bad server

SHIT GAME

Same thing every year, not worth buying if they never fix anything. Also, ea needs to relax on micro-transactions & allow all players the chance at meta cards w/o spending thousands of dollars.

nice fifa

The game is total mess, from defending to attacking this new AI is terrible.

this game is so fucking shit when it comes to the passing and the keepers, this company has millions of fucking dollars and cant figure out how to fix the fucking keepers i hope they fix this stupid fucking bullshit in the future

fdfxsreefg

good for half the price 


best game

By far the worst version of fifa I have ever played. I play mainly career mode, it is horrendous. The quality of gameplay is so poor compared to every single previous from year 2020 to now. They have painfully obviously added insane levels of scripting into the game, which I have proven by changing the sliders of my team to max, and the CPU to 1. It makes zero difference to gameplay. They are just as fast, just as aggressive, just as accurate. It's a disgustingly lazy attempt to make the game feel more "difficult" but it is actually just frustrating for the whole player base. Waste of time, stick to previous versions. This will be the last one fifa I buy.

aaa

Don't recommend. Low quality UX. Insane menu system. Just cant run multiplayer match with friend. Gave up after 30 minutes of trying. Just a waste of money.

So disappointing game.. Career mode is not developed, not even close for a manager game, Game mechanics are based on player strenghts purely, not at all relevant what you set up on tactics it wont work if you dont spend a lot of money for players that do actually play. Its a shame.. It was way better in the past.. 2010-2015. Now its just a money making machine game for young boys who dont understand a thing about it. Its all shiny on renders and goal joys, but its very poor on everything else. Even the commentary is so incredibly dumb. Fifa 2007 had better commentary and that was 18 years ago! I regret giving 25 dollars for it on christmas sale.. it doesnt worth 5 bucks.

Game is shit too buggy. this company is a disgrace all this money and can't even develop a proper game that is worth this money. We need a new game that can do this actually.

.

very fun with a loads of content but has bugs that need fixing

No noticable difference to last year's game.

Buggy game dont purchase

yes

Absolutely shit game. So many bugs and extremely high latency on pc even when the wifi speed is very high. Input lag on the game is insane even when my controller is already connected via usb. Just don't spend money on this game you will actually regret it. We should just close down ea at this point

just returned it, not worth to buy at all, the game is always lagging and stuttering in mid game

Just scummy ea

The gameplay is new, but personally i don't like it, it's trash it feels so heavy, a lot of new features specially for career mode so that's good point. but most important it looks like it's still have the same issues like eafc24, which is terrible online access/server. i played 1 or few games on clubs/pro clubs and it's running well, but i've exit to the lobby and when i tried to play clubs again it says "there was a problem getting your online information", and to fix that i have to restart the game every single time if that happens. so basically this game is still anjing

The worst money i spent this year. Really really bad. I still continue playing untill got enough coin and sell my account so I got my money back.

IF YOU PLAY CLUBS YES IF YOU UT DON'T BUY DJHIAHDASKHFDSUKAHKGAHLUGASJLHHNSJJOKLD

Shaolin soccer feels more like football compared to this game that is advertised as a football simulation. It is not a simulation.

0.65 out of 5 stars.

[h1] Been playing every FIFA/FC series since FIFA 13, and this is by far the most unplayable game in my experience. Not even mods can save this game anymore. [/h1]

[h2] This game is an absolute disgrace. [/h2] [b] I’ve stuck with the FIFA/FC series for over a decade, but FC 25 has officially broken me. The constant glitches are infuriating—every 30 minutes I’m forced to close the game because of a ridiculous bug that locks me on the menu screen. The only solution? Alt + f4, then wait another 5 minutes for the game to boot back up. This is a joke. I’ve never been this frustrated with a game in my life. [/b]

[h2] Let’s talk about the gameplay [/h2] [b] It’s the most scripted, broken mess I’ve ever played. In extra time, the AI turns into an unstoppable force, always scoring a last-minute equalizer or the winning goal like clockwork. It doesn’t matter if I’ve been dominating for 90 minutes; the game always finds a way to snatch a victory from me and make all my efforts feel pointless. The game actively punishes you for trying to win and turns your time into a complete waste. [/b]

[b] The actual gameplay mechanics are painfully slow, clunky, and downright boring. Everything feels sluggish, as if I’m playing in slow motion. The players don’t respond like they should, and simple tasks like dribbling or passing feel like a struggle. When I’m playing Youth Tournament Rush Mode, the game refuses to recognize the controller and forces me to switch to keyboard and mouse—an absolute nightmare. The only solution? You guessed it, Alt + F4, for it to happen again the next day. [/b]

[b] Then there’s the blue eyebrow glitch, the UI that highlights white so I can’t see the numbers during negotiations, and the worst part is that I don’t even expect EA to fix anything at this point. At this stage, I’m not asking for fancy new features or improvements—I’m literally just begging for a working game that doesn’t fall apart after an hour of gameplay. How hard is it to create a game that doesn’t require constant restarts and frustration? EA has completely dropped the ball, and I’m done. [/b]

[b] EA has completely ruined what was once a great series, and they couldn’t care less about the people who’ve been loyal to the series for years. I am beyond disappointed, and I’ll never recommend this game to anyone. If you value your time, your money, and your sanity, stay far away from this disaster. Don’t waste your time on a game that barely works and actively ruins your experience. [/b]

Bought it since I saw it at a 60% discount as part of a bundle (thank you steam and lord gaben) to see if they fixed anything from last year and....

.... Literally nothing was fixed. it still has the same glitches while running the game. just another proof that they legit just copy pasted the game, and that they don't care about the PC platform. 

I've got a 2080 Super and an i9-10980HK which should handily play this game at least on medium settings at 120fps, but as always they didn't care about optimising the game. There's just too much stuttering in game. 

The best part about the game is that the refund button worked exceptionally well (glory to steam and lord gaben once again). I highly doubt I would've been able to get it refunded on console. The players should vote with their wallet, and the FIFA community should stop spreading their cheeks and mouths for EA, and stop accepting half baked slop.

This game is way too buggy to be 80 dollars on initial release. Stutters, crashes, locked in certain screens, and other smaller tedious bugs that make the game unfun. What makes it strange is that at first it played relatively smooth but went downhill for some reason. Bugs aside, game-play has definitely been better in the previous FIFA/EAFC installments. long balls going to the moon even after only tapping it, headers are all over the place, players not playing the roles that they were commanded to, etc. Some player customization's are locked in certain modes and available in others. Add diversity to modes such as career mode by including said options (hats, hair, facial hair, whatever to make it more immersive). All these issues have been talked about many times, yet the devs either blissfully ignore it or don't care enough about to do anything. FIFA/EAFC has always had a high ceiling that unfortunately hasn't been fulfilled yet. Love this game and I've personally been trying to make it worthwhile, but it's long. Don't get the game until there's a huge sale.

i cant even play the game it constantly crashes thanks to their brilliant anticheat software, i dont need to mention its the same fucking game every year with bullshit "changes" to the previous ones. and of course no do not buy it better yet dont buy anything from this fucking dipshit vile disgusting company.

What is there to say about the latest FIFA that hasn't already been said. 

I'll base my review on my experience with Career Mode only, as it has always been my only interest in the franchise. 

Having missed the last few installments, I'm disappointed to not see many changes from the last game I've played, '21. 

The game isn't really much different, but there are positives to the overall presentation. While I can't comment on the yearly visual upgrades and the overall changes to the game presentation, it does feel it's closer to a real football game than ever before. While graphically the engine feels a bit outdated in certain areas, the implementation of various scenes before games, the attention to detail that are present in the audio and video presentation of teams is top-notch. Most teams home ground do feel unique, having unique songs, chants, stadium presenters, mascots and the like. This happens in most top leagues and while they were present in previous games, they seem to be at an all time high quality wise. 

However, downsides also come with this approach, as you'll sometimes feel a bit disconnected from actual gameplay and will feel as there are way too many cutscenes and visual interruptions to properly play the game. There just seems to be a lot of fluff to cover up some gameplay holes that have not been fixed for years and have been overlooked once again. But I'll get to that. 

Visually, the game is impressive. Stadiums, crowds, pitches and replays looks awesome. They feel well connected and everything just seems to be visually pleasing both by individual elements, as well as the sum of their parts. It's a cohesive visual direction which suits the game greatly. 

Audio is a mixed bag however. While the sound making up the atmosphere is pretty great, with crowds and stadium cheers sounding great, stadium songs for certain clubs are greatly produced and even stadium announcers seem to talk more and have more information than you'd think they would in a videogame, other aspects are lacking. The sounds of a player kicking the ball, the goalkeeper saving a shot, or the ball hitting the post, just sound a bit dull and repetitive. They're also the ones we've known for years. And talking about repetitive, the commentators seem to be getting worse and worse as each new game in the series has launched. Gone are the days of Andy Watson and Ally McCoist. There just doesn't seem to ever be a sense of occasion or real excitement from the commentators. Their performance is bland, dull and repetitive. While other audio elements can shine, commentators have been so disappointing that I ended up turning them off. The music in the menus doesn't even deserve a mention, completely forgettable. 

Gameplay has always mattered the most. It also seems to be the one thing about the game that hasn't really changed much over the years. Can you really notice much change year-by-year? I can't, it just plays and feels like any other FIFA from the past few years. There are still things that don't really work. Headers are still extremely weak for instance. I can't, for the life of me, seem to be able to score from a cross. Ever. Passing has also not changed much. It's still imprecise, especially in tight areas. Players often feel clunky, they rarely seem to move as fast as AI players. They always stumble on the ball much more, they always feel like they're just missing a beat, a step behind. Passing can be frustrating, but not only because passing itself can feel cumbersome from the imprecise controls, but also because players you are trying to pass to almost never do what you'd expect them to do. If you're trying to pass to a player making a run, it will happen well too often for that player to stop his run and turn back, only to miss the ball because it runs too far and he turned back. The only reason you're passing to him in the first place is because he's making a run. But he just stops. There are situations where a player is coming towards you and you'll pass to where he will be by the time the ball reaches him, but he'll suddenly start running backwards, away from the ball, thus losing the ball and the AI intercepting. All these small moments, among various others, happen way too often to think passing actually works. It gets frustrating, considering the fact that this has been happening for years and not much has changed. The problem is caused mostly by the unpredictability of the player you are passing to, not the passing itself. Players just seem to have a mind of their own. Another issue that's been present for years has been the inability of your team to go forward. Players will stay close to you, fullbacks won't run forward and make runs, no matter what your tactics are. Counter attacks can sometimes work. Those are some of the greatest parts of the game, you can score by having three passes in total, from your own box to scoring a goal. But those moments happen too rarely, because most of the time, your players don't go forward, don't make runs (only forwards do), are always too close to the player with the ball. 

I feel there are too many issues similar to these that make the experience not worthwhile. I could go on about the offside still not working properly all the time or the way too often moments of the AI players and yours just bumping into eachother, with the AI always getting away with the ball in every situation. There are too many things that just don't work and haven't been addressed in years. 

Some things do work better than before. Defending has never felt better. DM's and CM's are vital in defending and I've never had as much fun defending in a FIFA game. Pressing is a mechanic that you will have to learn if you're not used to it, as it is key to successful defending. It's also neat that it works great and is dependable. The way in which you can force the AI into mistakes and block passing lanes has never felt so satisfying. Tackles also feel heavy and impactful. Shooting isn't half bad, it can feel imprecise at times, but feels improved and reliable in most situations. Free kicks are quite fun and corner kicks have never felt as precise. 

The game has too many elements to properly address in a short review like this. Overall, it feels lacking because it hasn't had a proper gameplay revamp in years. While the visual presentation is top notch, the gameplay is so subpar in comparison, that you'd think the game is 15 years older than it actually is. I wouldn't recommend the game unless at a steep discount. If you're a fan of the series and have played it annually, you know exactly what you're getting into. It's such a shame there is no real competition for the series anymore. Competition has always brought innovation, but as things stand, we'll be saying the same things about the next game in the series.

The stuttering was so horrible that I was forced to refund the game, it was literally unplayable. Apparently it's something to do with the anti-cheat.

I rarely ever write Steam reviews, but GOOD LORD this game is so poorly developed. If it's not crashes and random disconnects that ruin your game, you can still count on freezing menus to guarantee your lack of having a good time.

It's a great sadness that there isn't a good football game to compete with this pile of steaming horse feces, because the moment that one DOES come along, this game will fall into the shitter.

the game in general is good but sometimes the game decides to pick a favorite in the middle of the game that ruins everything

Not Worth the money they don't care about the customers don't want to fix the game only want you money they do not fix any glitches in the game that make the game unplayable

How EA spends millions on this game every year and it's still worse than the last one still baffles me. Defending and tackling got worse, passing somehow got worse, Ultimate team is still pay to win, and players still copy pro tactics that were to inspire "creativity". I must admit that they did make Clubs better(especially for AI defending) and added sbc storage for Ultimate team but it does not out weigh the thousands of cons. Im happy I did not waste 60 dollars on this game because it is truly terrible and I really hope someone can compete with EA in the near future.

Honest review:
Somehow they managed to make the same game but extremely poor optimised compared to 23 . I'm not talking only performance wise but server wise also 
the game is just not worth at all is like a worst copy of 23 and 23 was already pretty bad also

P.s. the new tactics are weird but it's probably just a learning curve but for me are just bad and not my cup of tea

Like every year there is a new ''fifa'' game comming out .Ihave to admit the graphics and visuals look good but mechanics and physics are so unrealistic and broken .I got the game for 60% off else i would never pay 60 bucks for that crap .Iplayed the game for like 2 hours and already got some problems .You cant change the commentary in the menu : you have to change language before getting in the menu and thats kinda dump .Than if you play goalkeeper carrer mode your gk sometimes wont dive letting in some ridicolous goals .I have seen youtubers complain about it a few months and its still an issue .Its a problem EA because that doesnt help me get a good trainer sore if i concede unnescecery goals .And last but not least sometimes there are some visual bugs where the hand of a player does a 360 turn or you spawn at the opositions gk site .In overall cant recommend FC 25 or all EA games anymore because its obvious what their visions are : Money

Don't waste your money on this game...
The usual EA/FIFA problems:
- pay to win
- unfair matchmaking (doesn't matter what div are you in, you will face players from higher divs)
- scripting ( yes it does exist)
- passing/shooting and pretty much every aspect of the game is working randomly
- pack weight is horrible
- toxic playerbase
The only good aspect of the game are the Evolutions.

This game is a piece of shit scripted cocksucking monkey bullshit. Switch to the other football simulators, they are getting better.

the worst game of footbal i have ever played since 2014 the game its just reboung city every game evry play green times don t work this game is just trash .... don t buy it

The game has been broken for a month after they updated their anticheat. There is a forum post with about 400 pages of people complaining. They havent fixed it yet nor have they acknowledge their mistake.

Hopefully there comes a game that makes them compete for their fanbase, otherwise EA FC its destined to be a unfinished, money grabbing, consistently awful game.

Do not buy this game. I miss the old FIFAs so I still try to love these EA FC games but genuinely they are trash. Riddled with bugs and the game is always decided by AI mistakes rather than skill. When purchasing on PC the game looked like it belongs on the PlayStation 2. Graphics were terrible and performance was even worse no matter how many visual settings I changed. RIP FIFA.

Of all the Fifas, this is the most lazy, scripted, terrible, game I have seen. They clearly do not care about the player. Do not buy this game. I repeat, do not buy this game. Why would you take skill out of the game? I can feel the other team score as soon as they rainbow my forward in the back line. It just decides that there is nothing you can do, and cheats. This is a terrible system, made by terrible programmers and producers. They should be ashamed of what they produced after years of trial and error. I hope they never are allowed to make a game again. This is what failure looks like. EA is done, FIFA is done. I hope another game can take up the mantle with even a spark of respect and honesty. EA is cancer.

ERROR AND STUCK AT SPLASH SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LIKE WTF , I CANT PLAY THIS GAME . not play but I CANT OPEN THIS APP WTFFF

Sh*t game. Every year same, but there is only one football game so...

This game is completely broken on Manager mode, it has a lot of bugs but the most infuriating one is the substitution bug in the second half for Manager mode.
When you try to sub a player out in the second half, you are stuck in the team management screen without the ability to switch players, and the worst part is, YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO PLAYING/SIMULATING THE GAME, you are forced to restart the game and that is the worst possible bug in this game for manager mode, I do not know what other bugs this game has in the other game modes.
EA are focusing on FUT and dont give a damn about the other game modes


This game is not optimized for PC. There are a lot of stuttering during the game which makes the game an unenjoyable experience. Waste of money

marketing crossplay but it doesnt work since consoles have different patch. Refunded, trash company

This game lags all the time
i have a 4080 and 7800x3d and i cant play this is 1440p without lagging and stuttering all the time
wish i didnt buy this game

Been playing the series since Fifa 05 with my cousin. Always loved it. But this one is awkardly shitty. I find it funny how bad this is. Good job for making such a bad game EA.

The game recommends gambling and if you only play career mode the player AI is a piece of shit

I have an RTX 4060 and for some reason this game lags so much. All my other games like RDR2 and Hogwarts Legacy work without any lag. I know its not my connection because I get like 200 Mbps. Definitely don't buyif you have a pc.

Another year, more money, more garbage. Save your money, this will go down as the worst fifa to ever exist, completely unplayable garbage. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse they've gone and released this. Do yourself a favour and wait for either FIFA, or 2K to make a footy game.

Don't buy this shit game...I bought it recently and after playing it on the first day, the game crashes every time i try to open it..tried everything possible still same issue..No customer support from steam/ea side

The only mode that has received any sort of effort whatsoever over the last decade is a micro-transaction centered live service game. This poses 2 problems 1. the bang-for-buck for your spending is AWFUL and a joke. buy coins instead, you run the risk of getting coin wiped but you're getting screwed otherwise 2. the live-service aspect is thrown together week after week with nothing new in years. It's like a social experiment to see how much money EA can extract from their customers while putting little to no effort into anything that doesn't directly suck money out of the players.

player career AI is trash
they dont even know how to tackle the ball, just starring at it

game's absolutely terrible, gameplay is so bad, ea needs to fix this asap

As if the in-game bug wasn't enough of a problem, I'm struggling to even get the game to start. My worst FC experience, lots of bugs. The game won't open, which used to be a problem, but not so much, this is the last one. Because we pay $35 and $60 every year and it doesn't seem to improve. They are making the same game worse. I want my money back. This game is a waste of time. Matching system, server problems, packing errors, game does not open How can a game get worse every year?

Buggy asf mess shithole of a game. The game doesn't even work lmao. The game froze in substitution screen so I had to alt f4 now entire career mode save doesn't load in. Steam needs to remove this garbage from store .

high end pc.ryzen 7 7840hs 16 gb ram 6gb 4050. yet the game has to be run in low quality and still with lag.this game has been shit since fifa23.


the tutorial is very hard to understand. The information is not clear...

The Game runs really really bad!!!! The Performance is trash!!!!
DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!!!!!!!!

this got to be the worst game I have ever played its so bad the passes dont go where you want them and it keeps bugging I it kept kicking me out of the game.
this got to be not the worst fifa of all time but the worst video game of all time.

is the shitest fifa of them all , dont buy this game if you care about your mental health.

Most Unrealistic game ever ! Don't buy ! Absolutely Trash !

bullshit AI of defend，a lot of bug. Don't know how do FC game could learn to WE

This game is the definition of disappointment.
Gameplay feels too slow , have too many bugs compare to fc24, career mode have some issue as well.
If you have fc24 not bother buying this one , actually IMO fc24 feels better.

After editing the formation and tactic for a team in edit team sheets main menu, the edited changes is not saved when you have turned the game of and then on again. How to fix it???

The worst fifa / fc I have ever played. The opposing defensive AI are insane; never fucking make any mistakes at high difficulties. My team's AI also has the worst positioning ever. I do not recommend this game to ANYONE unless you wanna kill yourself irl.

To Whom It May Concern,

I want to express my deep disappointment with the game FC 25. I was eagerly anticipating this release, but unfortunately, the experience was very underwhelming for several reasons:

Overall Quality: The graphics feel almost identical to previous versions, with little noticeable improvement. There are also numerous technical glitches that disrupt the gameplay experience.

Gameplay Mechanics: The movements and interactions in the game feel unrealistic and sluggish, making the experience less exciting and enjoyable.

Content: The game doesn’t offer any truly engaging new content. Most of the additions feel like minor tweaks or repetitions of past ideas.

Value for Money: Considering what was delivered, the game’s price is too high and doesn’t reflect the quality or experience expected.

I hope the developers take this feedback seriously to improve the future of the series. As a loyal fan, I sincerely hope to see releases that live up to players' expectations.

Sincerely,


this game fucking sucks. Worst fifa ever. whoever made this shitty fucking game should go fuck themselves in a fucking fire and get cooked like a fucking pig. fuck this stupid ass game

I don't play ultimate team yet I know there is glitches and the free kick training in career mode doesn't work

This game used to be great, I've played it on console since day one & purchased every version year in, year out, however, it's been slowly going downhill for the past 5yrs or so & these last 2 versions (FC24/FC25) have been the worse to date.
The numerous bugs, glitches & frame rate drops is ridiculous on the PC version, don't get me wrong, it still has issues on the console, but the PC version is way worse, it's clunky & feels like it's not been optimised properly & I'm sorry to bring it up again, but the frame rate drops are just too consistent that it ruins the flow of the game & I might not be running a high end rig but an i9 9900k with 64gb of Ram & an RTX 4060ti should be running this game smoothly like it does all my other games (Inc' the new Indiana Jones game).

So as much as I've always loved this game & also the fact every other football game is rubbish, your only real choice is EA FC (& it's glitchy, never to be fixed issues of which I'll likely put hundreds of hours into) or playing with yourself (which would probably be more enjoyable, but not so great if someone walks into your room lol)...

Clubs is great but ultimate team is s**t. Horrible matchmaking and gameplay on FUT

The most unrealistic and unplayable game i have ever play....

was leading 8 2 in a wl game and got "randomly" disconnected. any other app on my pc continued working perfectly when i got hit with the disconnect. if the kid who was losing 8 2 sees this. i will find you

This game is a big downgrade to FC24. Its absolutely TERRIBLE. Gameplay is so bad, you almost never enjoy the game. This game is an absolute rip off for even 10$ because all it does it fk up your mood. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHIT

Huge amount of bugs. Each of these bugs is not critical and not a game-stopper but you always see things that should be done better and it is little bit humiliating. I don't see why I should pay money for game AND be humiliated. Not recommended.

FC25 still have a lot of bugs. It's playable but is annoying when some text gone on the top of the graphic options, randomly the game doesn't recognise the controller, sometimes during the match,  the gameplay option are a bit confuse, etc. For now, if you have FC24, stick with it. Until EA fix some of the problems in FC25, I do not recommend the game.

For all parents, this is the worst game ever. This game will cause mental health issues for your children, therefore don't let them play it. I promise you that this game ought to be prohibited. It is nothing more than a gambling game with a flawed gameplay that makes you lose all of your mental sanity. This game is brain rot. It will ruin your day, month, and year, so please don't play it. This is a huge disaster that requires boycotting; it is not a game for amusement.

Bought and returned in 15 mins. Game does not work and gives DirectX Error while loading. Followed suggestion to fresh GPU driver update. That did not fix the issue and after reading through many posts on EA and Reddit I gave up and returned it. I should not be having this much trouble and wasting time to get a game to work. EA, get your act straight.

It doesn't have more than 60 fps in windowed borderless mode

New update Crashing before match even starts.. Unplayable

dont buy this game, verry buggy and rush is trash because of teammartes

Disappointed, bugs everywhere especially when substitute players on match and on scouting youth squad. Like a garbage. I pay it for the game, but the game did not serve well. please do not sell like this product quality.

Laggy, lots of bugs, expensive. Don't waste your time.

shit game man, too many things wrong for me to explain, just dont buy, its really really bad

every fucking time I play this shit it makes me wanna puke. Nothing works, not good way to make strats, it's only a pile of shit of gameplay that costs more than 2 weeks of food. Do you wanna do something productive with your time and chill for a bit? go to sleep. It's free, and at least you wont lose your fucking time, piece of shit EA

Berbat. EAFC 24'e delilercesine sövdüm, bir sürü problem yaşattı bana. Bunu açınca o gözüme iyi geldi o kadar kötü. Almayın aldırtmayın.

bug and stuck at manager career on some premier league game, same game with more non sense. ea being ea is the most money robber ever

really bad. too many bugs, bad content, grinding for the rivals and WL are way too hard only for bad packs. AND THE MOST ANNOYING THERES TOO MANY CHEATERS IN THIS GAME AND EA DONT CARE AT ALL

The worst Fifa i ever played: terrible performance (even offline), weird glitches in career mode, lags, bugs, stutter. If Ea won´t fix, this will be the last game i buy from them

Career Mode is Dogshit. try to make a change in the middle of a game and it simply crashes. Its been 28 years since the first fifa and they still cant do the most basic stuff.

Fuck you EA

Sincerely,
The community


You cannot play online with/against 3 Friends on 4 different consoles, but 11v11 with randoms on 22 different Playstations/PCs…Logic?
Give us a 2v2 option or Lobby System so we can Play online with Friends as if we were in the same room on one PlayStation/PC, cant be that hard to implement for a Multi Million Dollar Company ._.

It's good game, good career mode

but the there are the minus:
- font color when you set the value of the transfer or the wage
- sometimes the Launcher is not working

But, it's still fun to play it

The game isn't horrible if you play offline its very fun but if you play online you better have your card ready,there isn't much to say about this game its Fifa or FC all you do is play football nothing special,should buy this game?if its on sale Overall rating 8\10

full of hackers, nice game EA steal our money and make nothing of it. Waiting for other games like this.

DO NOT AND HEAR ME AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS THE BIGGEST SCAM IN HISTORY I WICH THAT I DIDN'T TOUCH THIS GAME A DAY OF MY LIFE THE GAMES ARE ALL SCRIPTED TO YOUR OR AGAINST YOUR FAVOR FULL OF GLITCHES AND A PURE P2W GAME

Issues that are being raised by the community are either fixed too late or not being addressed at all. 
Many people can't wait for the soundtrack to release of the game, this year a lot of misses in that regard as well, no need push "non-fifa" type of songs to the community

L Game. They made the gameplay worse than FC 24

Terrible menu interfaces, they just toke the old one and make it worse. It's the same old FC24 just worse.

Refunded!

EA sold FC25 for 28 Euro as a deal because I own 24 and it still got refunded this has to be the worst iteration of football I have ever seen.

I bought ea play pro membership when FC25 released played about 500 hours,
Those 500 hrs were filled with cheaters, Broken UI and HUD elements, Broken SBC's, 
Disconnection bug, speed up and lag bug, SBC bug that would be completed then kick you out of sbc and game,
When you go back to the sbc everything is changed the players position the formation etc.

The packs are the biggest scheme in any game I have ever played almost like a lottery some of these players are unachievable for most of the community unless they drop thousands on pixels.
I'm sorry but I'm Just not dumb enough to spend all my money on packs of pixels for one season.
As a free to play player for the most part never hit a good trade-able card in 5+ years Highest trade-able card as a f2p player was prob 300k, Meanwhile the squads you go up against in high divisions average a squad value of 3-5 million coins some a lot more.

Not to mention the scripting this game used to be fair in a sense of 1v1 competition, Now it's all scripted for certain things to happen at certain times in the game making it absolutely unplayable. 

If 90% reads the script and you won't or can't you will get smashed 100% of the time because EA won't be honest and tell you the game is designed around scripts such as kickoff momentum or scoring too many goals before the 30 minute if you know the scripts it's an advantage,
But EA won't tell you, 

This is how to play the game there is zero skill ceiling in this game anymore not worth time and investment with no skill ceiling, predatory micro-transactions and scripted game-play to give you the assumption the team you own is to weak and upgrades are needed. I would like to say at least 60-80% of the community is falling for this trap of get scripted to look like ur team is bad so you go buy more packs like a fish.


Lets hope 2k make a fifa because if they do it will be the best there will be skill involved although they are still bad with micro-transactions it willl be 1000% better than EA, 

We could get a football neighbourhood 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 street football who knows but what EA is putting out every year, 
It's just an updated hud with new player cards and they cannot even get that right everyone can agree rush was a massive failure skill again not a thing, Keeper is special and you would be lucky to get a single game where someone actually plays the game instead of AFK on the sidelines, 

That's how much people want to play EA 90% of the time the players go AFK so they don't have to play for the rewards and just get them for free by AFK farming oh yeah and the developers ain't smart enough to come up with counters to it. 
New card designs if only I could attach images here XD 
The card designs are so broken installed yesterday after buying it and I got a prem LB globetrotter can't remember his name plays for brighton his card was grey with an error on it saying "NOT FOUND" This bug I can remember being a thing for the last 5 years where card designs are just broken.

Also game runs a million times worst on steam than it did on EA play pro.



Horribly optimised for PC 

Constant micro stutters with any settings, any driver, any resolution. 

No support for any monitors or laptops above 120hz. Must go into config files to change refresh rate (even then, its hit and miss) 

No DLSS support currently 

Its been an extremely painful experience so far trying to even get a smooth game. 

I would get a refund but the fool is me for redeeming the ultimate edition before i played a game

EA just try launching a game that works, its just a money making machine for them. They abuse the fact that we all love football. Honestly EA is just a fraud which comes out every year with a new peice of S@#!

this game have no fun anymore. quick passing dead. without skill move you cant do anything. worse edition.
we are not compi player, we are playing this game for fun. but you guys made this too much hard to handle. a soudi team can beat any team if he have excessive high press on,  ball control and skill move.

It’s a nice game, I’d say, but it feels like it should have been an update for FC24 rather than charging us ₹2000 for a new version. I really dislike EA’s tactics like this. The only thing I genuinely enjoy is that I like FIFA games in general.

I only play at this moment because is the only game and all my friends play here but serious EA is a joke. everything is scripted, full of hacker( just look on youtube) and on top of that they don't even give you the rewards you earned playing really hard. I play fifa since 1998 and is getting worst year by year. I have been complaining for some times for this rewards and still on this day they just don't care! trust me look after your health and don't bother to buy this game!

its a fantastic game and 5v5  added which makes it 10x better than fc 24

This game with friends goes crazy but even if your alone the competative side of it can keep you hooked

Amazong graphics game and everything

The game play is still far from ideal and the servers gets slow when too many players are playing. It is just unacceptable from EA.
