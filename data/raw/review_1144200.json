I was expecting that after several YEARS in early access, the developers of this game would have been smart enough to optimize their game's core systems, rather than simply layering more barely-usable content on, alas, we are where we are. \n\nSuspect AI is simultaneously oddly efficient and horribly incompetent. I have had DOZENS of scenarios where a suspect will acknowledge my presence, yell several voice lines of engaging me or my AI teammates, and simply stand in place with their gun at a low ready. When the AI does work, most of the time it ends up firing precisely at you through multiple surfaces, even after breaking contact through walls. They will often sprint while shooting, which does not seem to reduce their accuracy at all. What's even odder about this is that the suspects are stupidly easy to deal with! Often it is possible to surprise them, even if you've just exploded a door one single room over, they seem to do very little damage, and they are very simply just Not Smart. It doesn't feel like a desperate person robbing a store, or highly trained assassins anymore, the suspects feel like Suspect AI that are often just robotic and confusing.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is the devblogs showing us multiple \"cool new things\" the suspect AI can do. They can sneak around you, pick up weapons that have been dropped, kill themselves when at critical morale, set traps, prepare ambushes, try to stab you with a knife if surrendered, squeeze through small gaps, hide under beds and in closets, all kinds of interesting ideas. However, THEY NEVER ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THESE. In about 60 hours of playtime after the largest \"suspect overhaul\", I have never seen a suspect kill themselves, hide, flank, or anything of the sort. The primary behavior I see is AI behaving like ChatGPT attached to a camera, before becoming an Ultrakill character and sprinting at maximum velocity while shooting.\n\nFriendly AI also suffers this odd hybrid issue of being incredibly broken and incredibly cracked as well, though. Often the friendly AI gets confused and fully locks up on doorways, hallways, stairs, attempting to arrest people, or even just on a simple lip of a hallway. They sometimes will run off in an absolutely inane fashion upon being told to search a single room, often getting killed running of on their own. They often ignore contacts and will be killed like lemmings if an order is issued that for some reason prevents them from moving while engaging. The friendly AI is also incapable of dealing with hostage situations, and will in my experience, 100% of the time reliably gun down both the civilian and suspect. \nHOWEVER. When the AI DOES finally work, they are incredibly efficient and accurate*, and are actually somewhat enjoyable to interact with, until they stand in a door paralyzed again. \n\n*(They hit 30% of the shots they take. Suspect AI lands about 50% and is usually much more willing to open fire and move away.)\n\nCurrently, the game just exhausts me. It used to be an enjoyable experience. The suspect AI was actually quite reactive and tough to deal with in earlier versions, a few years ago, which I found enjoyable. There were multiple scenario options for each map, like bomb threats or raids with incredibly aggressive AI that you were allowed to kill on sight. The mission UI on the board in the station even has this system left in it! The \"Barricaded Suspects\" text on every single mission is completely vestigial from this time, as barricaded suspects used to be the default and easiest scenario! \n\nOverall, the game is just.... Sad.\n\nThe thick environment, grime, suspense, that it claims to inherit from SWAT 4 are gone. Sometimes it shines through in the subtle soundtrack of a rainy map, or the way a room is lit, but the issues with the game are inexcusable and have been built so far into the game's very core it will be impossible for it to recover. \n\nReady or Not has not found it's identity. It flip-flops between being a realistic police simulator in text, while hinting at government conspiracy with it's gameplay and lore, but when you play the game its essentially just a game about surprising unengaging AI in various ways in a sandbox with a very small layer of story and polish put into it.\nThe story is simply not present outside of what are essentially the Arkham City audio logs and some admittedly okay environmental setup. The gameplay is frustrating, uninteresting, and unintuitive. The environment and world is occasionally a bright spot, before another ragdolled dead civilian turns into spaghetti through half the map again. The tone I get from this game is raw confusion and disinterest.\n\nI hate to discuss motivations, but I really don't think the developers care very much about this game anymore. I think they've built something on a sandy foundation that they knew would collapse, but are far too deep in to fully fix anymore. The priority seems to be on selling new DLC content, which I can understand from a small team that needs funds, however this game has been such a runaway success that I'm really not sure where that money is going. I KNOW the developers are smart enough to fix these issues, I KNOW they CAN do it, because they've done it in the past, and they've made some genuinely interesting systems for the AI, so I'm left to conclude that they either simply do not care enough, or the people who made those awesome things are not working anymore.\n\nSimply, this is not SWAT 5. Los Suenos is deader than an actual Exxon gas station in the middle of nowhere. While some missions successfully capture the tone of the SWAT series, if only for a second, it loses it in the next. \n\nHeavy topics such as human trafficking, acts of mass violence, systemic societal deficiencies, immigration, drug production, sexual abuse of minors, and even MKUltra are touched on, but no more than simply at a surface level of \"Hey look, aren't we cool for showing this.\" The game comes across as entirely an entirely surface-level, COD MWII No Russian-level of engagement with policing. It seems like shock value, marketing, buzzwords, not actual storytelling.\n\nThis is, at it's core, a sandbox, and a very small, uninteresting one at that. There are, at least on paper, several interesting parts to this game. None of them work. If one eventually does work for you, it will be at about halfway capacity. Even without the issues, the game at it's core is just bland. It's lost the SWAT spirit of highly atmospheric maps. The color grading is awful. The suspects aren't engaging. The environments can be pretty to look at, but they aren't characters themselves like they were in SWAT 4. Teammate AI is randomized, and often has exactly one unique line of dialogue per mission. Everything is just kind of off, and overall, this is categorically one of the most loosely designed, balanced, and conceived games I have ever seen. \n\nI'll probably keep playing for nostalgia and for the occasion my friends decide to play, but this game is not worth any price above five dollars. I am sorry, VOID, but you've really let me down. I was betting on you for quite a while, but you've absolutely failed to deliver a product marketable as anything close to a SWAT sequel, let alone a product worth FIFTY US Dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanna see something more interesting than this game, go to literally any grimy, dirty, weird gas station at like 8pm in the winter.

I think both the AI and the performance have both gotten to a point that has finally made me uninstall and that's without even trying any new maps from DLC 2.

PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW:\n\n-suspect SEE'S me, responds verbally, but slowly starts raising their gun at me, refuses to back down after being threatened by MY WHOLE TEAM..AND I'M STILL PUNISHED FOR DROPPING HIM????\n\n-when breaching a room, the AI automatically prioritize YOU as a target every single time despite.....from the enemies perspective, there isn't anything special about you. Yes, this still happens even IF you were the last person to enter, or you just hang out outside the room while your team clears it. like there is no winning with this AI because unless you drop them first, YOU WILL be seeing \"Hold F to stop Bleeding\" more than actually working on the objectives, or literally anything else. there is even a chance this could happen when the team breaches ACROSS THE MAP, granted the enemy can't hit you through so many surfaces in this case, but this just feels absurd, aggravating even.\n\n- another ridiculous thing is how the AI is able to see you in some cases. at complete random you WILL start getting shot at, and you will not be able to accurately determine which way you're being shot at from as having one round pass by you reduces your aim to room temperature ice, and even when you DO find the perp on perks, they....\n\n- will tank whole magazines if your caliber is lower than 5.56mm if that NPC has a vest that looks like they got it from Ebay, or TEMU. they won't even FLINCH, and in many cases if they're using the same caliber as you....( lets use 9mm in this case )\ntheir bullets feel like they could be one shot head shot. where as yours feel like you just hurt their feelings.\n\n-if the perp takes 17 shots, and collapses, never assume they're dead because they could still get back up to not surrender for a SECOND time; this is forgivable to a degree as many times the positions these NPC's collapse in often don't leave you with any ability to cuff them without risking yourself by creeping into the suspects sights. this could be fixed by giving me the option to drag them by an arm/leg behind cover, thus reducing risk.\n\n- somehow shooting the ground near the suspects feet A: still wounds them, and B: still counts against your score... this is just unfortunate as the AI sometimes get stuck in an animation, and doing this in my experience is an effective way to override the animation lock. like using new code to override old code; this is helpful especially around bigger hallways where its important to keep your primary out in case some rando with a gat rears the corner so you can keep em from squad wiping everyone. I know there are non-lethal options but A: you can still catch these demerits for using them like you were using bullets, and the taser just means \"oh i just used 1 of my 2 shots to detain one person\" ....in a building with WHO KNOWS how many suspects.\n\n- without any lights, NVG's, or any way to actually see into extremely dark area's, will still shoot you through three walls...\n\n\nand so far im only mentioning the enemies, but your AI  TEAMMATES will annoy you even FURTHER by:\n\n- having they're nav-mesh glitch consistently around stairs, forcing you to assume the lead, and putting you at risk because your team forgot how stairs work\n\n-if you are engaged in a firefight, and your team isn't tasked with anything, then your AI team will WALK INTO YOUR LINE OF SIGHT WHILE YOU ARE FIRING, just to do what you were already doing: handling a hostile situation, this could be negated by taking away friendly fire penalties for AI teammates (when within 3 feet) unless said friendly fire results in death, but I still get why its a feature....\n\n-sometimes the AI squad will lock eyes with a wall, and IGNORE ALL SENSORY INPUT, yes including getting shot at, or shived. (was able to determine the AI was locking onto a perp making noise in an adjacent room, but gets stuck as it doesn't have a line of sight)\n\n-the new helicopter observer helps, but with no way to direct the cameraman, then it makes using the helicopter needlessly tedious. if the camera guy is too far zoomed in on IR, I can't feasibly tell where that random perp IS, so please include a command for that, or to at least acknowledge the sighting with \"Noted, keep scanning for more\" so the heli doesn't lock eyes on that perp like spongebob watches his flowers XD\n\n- in bigger rooms, you pretty much HAVE to order ALL FOUR MEMBERS to clear it as they WILL pull a scooby doo, and go \"LET'S SPLIT UP GANG\" without you to hold their hands, and when more than 7ft apart, somehow AI teammates is somehow dumber than patrick star with a board in his head, because they also become slow to respond to ANY IMMEDIATE DANGER.\n\nwhen the AI is this bad, it can greatly diminish the dark beauty that is the greater story of los suenos, and its silent commentary because, and just to borrow a quote from fleek on this, but you'll be forced to even \"Make your non lethal shotgun lethal, wake up before you get put to sleep\"\n\nlooks, sounds. story, I can't complain; I like where the devs are going, but they NEED to pay more attention to the AI, and one other feature...you thought I was done? NAAAAAAAW!\n\nLast major gripe i have towards this game is its reliance on Mod.Io\n\nMod.Io for Ready or Not....its NOT XD\nInsurgency sandstorms Mod.Io port is way more stable than Ready or Not's\n\nReady or Not's mod support will AUTOMATICALLY redownload mods you TRY to get rid of, be it  through the menu, deleting the mod files, uninstall through Mod.Io, it is SAVED onto Ready or Not, and when it can't reinstall the files it \"Redownloads\" WILL become corrupt making any boot up option outside of \"No mods\" WILL crash the game before it can boot up. so PLEASE.... GET. RID. OF. THE. CURRENT. PORT. for Mod.Io as it's clearly broken beyond use\n\nfor those that think \"no problem, i'll just use Nexus\"..... I wish you good luck, because nothing works on that end either, I've tried....overall I've given up on the cosmetic/audio mods I want to use because of how UNSTABLE modding can be for THIS game.\n\nAt least Insurgency Sandstorms Mod.Io support is able stable enough to actually work, contact their develop team, and try to figure out how they made that thing work, because from what I gather: Mod.Io has a pretty bad rep when it comes to the modding community. In this game, that BS just doesn't want to work properly, and i'd highly recommend just removing it from the game entirely as the whole point of a mod manager/workshop is to make my modding experience easier, not harder.\n\nI see the passion in the project, but with these flaws, I can't give this game a thumbs up, even though I enjoy everything else...i'll edit when next update comes out, and see if these get fixed", "timestamp_created": 1734310275, "timestamp_updated": 1734310275, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607312858104705811", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183173014": {"recommendationid": "183173014", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009779360", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 382, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1734982962}, "language": "english", "review": ">Check 15 doors for traps\r\n>No traps on any of those\r\n>Open 1 door without checking\r\n>Get blown up by a tripwire bomb\r\nNow I even check my bedroom door for traps\r\n10/10 PTSD simulator", "timestamp_created": 1734678612, "timestamp_updated": 1734678612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544190883636474609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182981270": {"recommendationid": "182981270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225034284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "playtime_at_review": 15488, "last_played": 1734463616}, "language": "english", "review": "Since of the addition of DLCs it seems you cannot mod the game if you don\u00b4t buy them because you cannot use older mods and neither the new ones since they are only updated to DLCs, pretty much making it a subscription if you want to use mods and destroying the story.\n\nI bought this game a long time ago and i have been a big fan of the project but this is just greedy.

(I know that sentence makes no sense; just go with it.)\n\nReady or Not is such a ridiculously immersive game, especially when played without the HUD. It puts you in the shoes of what is essentially a SWAT team leader, as you clear everything from crackdens, mansions, yachts, hospitals, and more, with every single location bringing a completely new setting and set of challenges to the table... In theory...\n\nWhile I absolutely recommend RoN if you're into slow-paced room-clearing games, in its current state, the immersion I was talking about previously hangs on by the smallest of threads. The game doesn't have any difficulty settings, so while I believe the game is much better now than it was at release (back then enemies were pinpoint accurate headshot machines), you quickly see that with even the most basic understanding of the maps and heavy armour equipped, all semblance of difficulty is quickly lost.\u00a0\n\nWhat is supposed to be a slow, methodical game about clearing rooms can quickly turn into a run-and-gun fest when you get even remotely comfortable with the mechanics. With heavy armour, you essentially become a walking tank, and as long as you don't literally reload your gun in the face of an enemy wielding a shotgun, you should be good. Luckily, you can pretty easily nerf yourself by putting on light armour, a stab vest, or even going in with no armour, but there's no reason to do that, because the 11 (currently glitched) slots the game provides are more than enough for literally every map.\n\nWith every major update / paid DLC, the developers add in stuff for free. Whether that's new guns, bug-fixes, AI updates, or balance changes. Yet with each such update, there's usually a bunch of new bugs that rear their ugly head, demolishing the immersion. Even if I ignore the fact that my AI squadmate got stuck in a wardrobe in the Lawmaker mission, the fact that the developers added new surrender animations that see the enemies literally pointing the muzzle of their gun at your head, yet you losing points if you shoot them in that animation, and even some of the slowest, most boring surrender animations known to man, none of that tops the fact that currently you can be arresting a suspect, walk out of that animation without fully arresting them, and for that specific suspect to become impossible to arrest. In a game about arresting people, doing that might trigger a glitch that forces you to either restart (trying to S rank) or incapacitate / kill the suspect.\n\nAnd that's just it. Would I recommend this game? Yes. Do I think it has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic game? Yes. Am I hooked on just how blood-pumping the experience can be? Yes. But do I also return every now and then, enjoy the experience, yet become frustrated and disappointed that nothing much has really changed?

One of the best hardcore tactical shooters out there. Very unforgiving, doesn't hold your hand.\r\n\r\nAlthough It's an amazing game that does live up to expectations as a tactical, first-person shooter - It could benefit from refinement.\r\n\r\nTo start :\r\n\r\n- Optimization in singleplayer is very lackluster, with cases of performance varying between systems rather than hardware specificiations. I have an RTX 3060 12GB, 16GB DDR4 RAM, i5-11400F. Considering the games RECOMMENDED requirements are a GTX 1060 6GB, my system should work wonders, no? Wrong. On singleplayer, SPECIFICALLY after the most recent updates, my fps has significantly tanked. During the Home Invasion update I was running at 90-140fps singleplayer. Varied based off of the map. Now? Can hardly push 40-60fps on most of the maps, even with my settings set to the lowest. Reason why? GPU Usage is incredibly low (~40-60%) for no reason. Improper utilization of hardware. Not pushing my rig to its limit. Though, for someone else with the same rig as me - they might have absolutely fantastic performance. It varies.\r\n\r\n-Multiplayer fixes some of the performance issues, at the expense of losing out on game progression and AI Teammates supporting you (or making your run significantly harder). \r\n\r\n- making the AI less superhuman - less penalizing if you accidentally blow their brains out. I don't like peaking a corner and then being greeted with a jumpscare :)\r\n\r\n- more customization options ; cosmetics, weapons, weapon attachments, maybe weapon styles in the same way where you can apply clothing styles? giving some weapons a black / tan variant, camo variant, etc etc.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of AI and Progression - the progression system is also quite nice. Unlocking cosmetics and other things alike based off of your performance in-game is a pretty rewarding system for if you do amazing, but also a very harsh system if you do absolutely horrible. You can't get caught slacking in this game like you could be on others - you get domed? you restart. you're not coming back from that.\r\n\r\nGunplay and mechanics are very impressive and smooth, though I'd recommend for anyone trying to get the upper edge when playing to replace your crouch keybind with freelean. Wider radius of angles and you can peak a bit overhead too.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer was very interesting the few times that I had played it with friends. Sometimes it worked - sometimes it didn't. Again, it varied a lot, for some reason.\r\n\r\nOverall - 10/10 game. Does it deserve a buy? I'd say yes, but only when it's on sale. For $50 I'd expect a game like this to arrive with both DLC, but I guess not. Buy it when it's on sale - and don't buy it standalone. Buy the Home Invasion Bundle or the LSPD Bundle. For lovers of games like Ground Branch, R6, Six Days in Fallujah, etc etc - you'll love this game.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734186162, "timestamp_updated": 1734186162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183414118": {"recommendationid": "183414118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045188602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3490, "last_played": 1724551287}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoy the game but I think the DLC is a little overpriced given what you get...

While the maps are truly stunning and are fun to play, they are empty. \nSimply as. You don't get a narrative nor characters or any story beats aside from the mission briefing and some minor (Easily-Missable) Banter with your squad, and this hurts the game and ruins any replayability. Void Interactive are incredibly talented development team especially due to its small size. These DLCs felt like they needed a narrative, an actual narrative one with dialogue and villains and a continuing storyline that isn't hiding in the background. Yet there is nothing of such here. You can do plenty with environmental storytelling, but you can also think you're doing something with it only to realise that you have told a nothing burger for your customers (Scorn).    \nWe need characters on every mission that would explain to us what is happening what are they feeling and what they think about the faction we are fighting. \n\nRight now we just have maps that represent a WHAT IF scenario for us to play around with. I have almost 69 (nice) hours on this game. Most of it is from redoing the mission in an attempt to S-rank it. But after I do I have nothing to fall on. \nWhile you may argue that \"you played for 69 hours, I think you can say that this game is highly playable\". Well, to that I say that those hours were accumulated during the start of the early access launch Which launched 3 years ago. Aside from the bare-bones multiplayer side and the singleplayer \"commander\" mode side. There isn't anything of massive substance yet. I truly believe that if this game would have a visible narrative one that isn't strictly environmental it would raise the bar and would truly solidify the game into being worthy of 1.0. \n\nTLDR: The base game is amazing. The game still feels unfinished and early access.", "timestamp_created": 1734306221, "timestamp_updated": 1734306221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183453708": {"recommendationid": "183453708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060552159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "playtime_at_review": 3033, "last_played": 1734931592}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty great and has given us the SWAT sequel we deserved. It's an excellent, gritty experience that succeeds in making a thrilling and often uncomfortable experience.  \n\nI do have some complaints. For starters, I understand the idea of using the police station as a navigable level for you to set up the game for you and your other officers. But there's just so many things that don't make sense. \n\nIt's very slow to load, even on an SSD. And you will have to load in and out of this level every time you start and end a mission. \n\nIf you are playing single player and die or want to restart, the only way to do so is to return to this level, then load back into the level where you died. There is a retry button in multiplayer lobbies, but not for singleplayer, which sort of discredits the argument that this is the developers way of saying \"You don't get second chances in real life.\".  I think it's more likely just a design oversight. \n\nIn a recent update, suspects seem to no longer surrender without beating them to comply. Before that was a relatively rare possibility, but now it seems to be vastly increased. Beanbag rounds and other less-lethal seem to be even more ineffective than they used to be. \n\nI'm obviously not intimately familiar with police protocol, but as far as I understand if you are refusing to comply, while holding/waving an automatic weapon in close proximity to police, saying \"I'm going to kill you\", you will be shot. However, even after giving people like this 10-15 seconds to comply, shooting them, even with less lethal such as a beanbag gun, will result in a penalty for excessive force. I've also shot the weapon out of the suspect's hand, or watched them go to surrender, only for an AI teammate to blow their brains out, with no penalty. Again, this is just after the latest update. Before it seemed to work a lot more believably.\n\nWhich brings me back to the management/police station. In Singleplayer after every mission you get informed how your fellow officers are doing. Do badly or make them do too many scary things like breaching, they'll get stressed. They can die or quit, etc. Sort of like XCOM. I've probably played 20 hours of the game since this update, and I still have no idea what it actually does, as I'm yet to notice an effect of a teammate's status. \n\nFor example, if one dies: Nothing happens. I believe when it first happens it says you need to hire someone new, but the game will just give you one, but it doesn't matter because they're indistinguishable from one another anyway.\nIf they're stressed or anxious, they don't seem to get trigger happy or do a fight/flight/freeze when in fights. I don't have to send them away to therapy or on medical leave, the game does that for you but again, the game just replaces them with another identical person who is as far as I can see no different. It seems like a system designed to make your care about your other officers and look after them, but ultimately it's implemented so poorly it made me more indifferent as a result of frustration than anything else. It feels like a last minute \"What if we had management mechanics?\" in a game that I don't think really needed more. \n\nIt's a blast in multiplayer if you can get a game.
