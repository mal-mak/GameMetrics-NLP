anywhere in gaming. Simply put, this is a Masterpiece. Elden Ring was my first ever Souls game. I originally brought it on PS4 and instantly became engrossed in the atmosphere and the challenge, i loved it so much i ended up getting the platinum trophy (my first ever). I then went on to play and subsequently platinum Dark Souls 1, 2 & 3, Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. After being wary of the Fromsoft games due to their reputation for so long, 'souls' & 'soulslikes' have become my favourite sub genre, and that is all thanks to Elden Ring.\n\nIn fact, it so good that

Couple of months later I try Elden Ring for the first time and... I don't like it. I went in totally blind and looked up nothing since so many people suggest going totally blind for your first playthrough. And I guess its a matter of personal preference but I was just completely lost, had no idea how character builds, upgrades or anything progression or combat related worked. I didn't even know dodge rolls gave you Iframes, my mind was operating on PS2 God of War logic where they're used to get AWAY from unblockable attacks, not rolling into them as you often have to do to avoid the sometimes ridiculous combos the bosses can pull off in this game. Got to Godrick and just got tired of being eternally confused, and dropped it just like DS1.\r\n\r\nFew months pass, and I'm craving a good Action RPG, but I've always found Diablo-likes to be a bit dull combat wise, and against my better judgement I decide to give Eldy another try, but this time I'm NOT listening to what most people suggested. I need help? I look it up immediately. I write stuff down in a notepad to remember for later,\r\nAaand I manage to fix a horrible and unnaceptable performance issue that should not be a thing at all in a game almost 3 years after release, please spend more than 2 bucks and a tuna can on PC ports large AAA studios, the insane sales you got from this game could more than afford you to fix these issues and I'm not overlooking them just because I spent far too many hours looking for a simple solution (I had to disable the CPU Frequency boost feature in my bios, limiting me to 3.6Ghz, but thats OK I GUESS??)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the game itself became really fun to play when I decided to help myself and suffer less. Early game was still a pain for me but once it 'clicked' I kind of got addicted for about 2 weeks, basically until I was close to beating the game. Yeah, that last part wasn't without merit, (LOCATION SPOILER AHEAD) after Leyndell, I didn't enjoy the game much, the northernmost part of the map seemed fairly empty, full of tanky enemies and bosses that did insane damage, forcing you to either be a god at dodging or go hard into vigor and get all the flask upgrades. Some of the mandatory endgame bosses made me lose kilograms of hair I swear (last and very dissapointing final boss sadly included SPOILER but Radagon Should've had two really cool phases, something like Godrick The Goated instead of having to fight a weird jellyfish very awkwardly after the former drains you of your flasks and irl mental and physical energy)\r\n\r\nAnyway, despite all of this complaining I do, this game was probably the best one I played through for the first time in 2024. Unlike all the cookie cutter open world stuff released today with surface level rpg mechanics, I Felt like I was playing something that matters, that wanted me to explore, go out and discover stuff, something that made me wonder, first game since I played Morrowind that made me feel like that, and that's not something to ignore.\r\n\r\nWell, that's it. I hope you didn't read any of this, if you did I'm sorry. I just thought the game deserved a positive review and needed to do something in place of sleeping. I will not be fixing mistakes as I did not care a single bit about what I wrote here.

[/h2]\n\nElden Ring takes the niche \"Dark Souls\" formula and widens its target to the general audience by seamlessly incorporating an open-world structure. I think it paid off brilliantly, transforming the Souls experience into something far more expansive and liberating. The open world not only encourages exploration but actively rewards it, pushing players to overcome hurdles and uncover [b]huge[/b] secrets. This constant push to explore creates a satisfying gameplay loop\u2014one that feels extremely rewarding, especially when you finally triumph over its daunting bosses. My first playthrough was special, and I couldn't rekindle the feeling in subsequent playthroughs or even the DLC, but I think there's true beauty in that.\n\nBut what I want to convey about this game, however- [b]what truly sets Elden Ring apart[/b], is its immersive worldbuilding. FromSoftware has always excelled at environmental storytelling, but this game pushes both the technical and artistic boundaries of what\u2019s possible in game design. Rather than relying on exposition or handholding, the story is carefully woven into the world itself\u2014scattered fragments of lore, cryptic dialogue, and environmental clues all come together in a way that exemplifies the [i]\"show, don\u2019t tell\"[/i] philosophy.\n\nNot to mention the level of detail poured into crafting Elden Ring\u2019s environments- it's breathtaking. As an environmental modeler myself, I was blown away. The ruins, architectural motifs, and atmospheric design don\u2019t just serve as backdrops; they are integral to the game\u2019s narrative. Exploring these spaces feels like uncovering the remnants of a forgotten history, and it\u2019s something rarely seen or executed this well in modern gaming. I legitimately feel like an archeologist when trying to tie in the story together when the graves of [i]elden[/i] civilzations are scattered here and there. I don't think I've seen it delivered in such a fashion in a video game before, and I've played [i]tons[/i] of single-player story games. \n\nFor fans of FromSoftware and newcomers alike, this game is something to enjoy and spend your time on.

From the very first moment you step into the Lands Between, you're immersed in a world that\u2019s as beautiful as it is dangerous. The open-world design is perfect, offering a vast landscape full of secrets, dungeons, and breathtaking vistas. It\u2019s a world where you can get lost for hours, and it never feels like you're just going through the motions.\n\nThe difficulty is classic FromSoftware\u2014challenging but fair. Every victory feels earned, and even the smallest achievements are rewarding. The bosses are some of the best I\u2019ve ever faced in a game, each with their own unique movesets and strategies to figure out. The thrill of overcoming these giant foes never gets old.\n\nThe freedom in how you can build your character is also one of the game's standout features. You can experiment with different weapons, magic, and abilities, crafting a playstyle that\u2019s uniquely yours. The combination of combat and exploration creates a perfect balance of excitement and satisfaction.\n\nGraphically, Elden Ring is stunning. The atmosphere, soundtrack, and visual storytelling immerse you in its world. It\u2019s not just a game; it\u2019s an experience. Whether you\u2019re exploring the desolate regions or fighting in epic battles, the attention to detail is incredible.\n\nMultiplayer elements, while optional, add another layer of fun. I\u2019ve enjoyed summoning friends to help with tough bosses or even just invading other players' worlds for a little PvP action.\n\nIf you're a fan of challenging games with a rich story, atmospheric world-building, and a sense of freedom in gameplay, Elden Ring is an absolute must-play. It\u2019s a game that respects your time and your skills, and that\u2019s something truly special in today\u2019s gaming landscape.\n\nIn short: Elden Ring is a work of art that will stay with me long after the credits roll.

There is a reactionary approach to enemy design here where most are centered around punishing habits developed in Dark Souls 3. This isn't bad if you're coming from said game, but isn't entertaining in it's own right. It's also the weakest story of any soulslike, despite having the most story of any of them. The game's open world nature doesn't justify itself and is instead a boring chore to move through as you explore, and then \"rewards\" you with instant fast travel when backtracking. You're given a mount for the first time ever in one of these games, but it's combat is only slightly more sophisticated than what can be found in Skyrim. There are also the two vestigial limbs of crafting and stealth which are so under baked that they might as well not even be here. As for visuals, the game requires Flawless Widescreen, Reshade, and low settings to not be painful to look at. This is also the most blas\u00e9 Fromsoft OST, and I say that as a big fan of ambient music. I actually play with music muted because of how the ambient tracks drone on. Lastly, performance is pretty bad even when testing with FPS uncapping mods on a 7800X3D and 4080 Super. Note that raising your FPS cap comes at the cost of disabling all online functionality, but considering the online features are toned down from previous games it isn't as much of a loss imo.\n\nOverall, ER is good at a lot of things but isn't really great at any one of them. I would have said it's the best soulslike to start with because of that, but it's enemy design throws a big wrench in that. Reading this review probably has you wondering why I'm giving this game a thumbs up at all. The truth is that ER is built on the shoulders of giants and has a very strong core gameplay loop that carries it above the recommend line.

While i cant say I agree with all the design choices in this game, what they've create undeniably WORKS.\r\n\r\nThis is a modern-day masterpiece and an instant classic.   The level design, tone, challenge, and sheer scope is incredibly impressive.  WELL WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.\r\n\r\nAlthough some aspects of it frustrated me because so  much of the mechanics are hidden or not explained, and i tried to play this game  as blind as possible,  it was hard to do it totally blind because:\r\n\r\n1) There is no quest tracking, if you miss a line of dialog even if by accident, it is not possible to see what was said, and obviously there are no markers on where to go to progress any of your quests.   There are no cheat sheets here (except looking stuff up online).  The game does NOT hold your hand in any way.   Your choices matter, even when you don't even understand you've made a choice, such as certain quests getting locked out based on your progression elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2) i found it very hard to manage the lock-on, which 'breaks' intermittently during combat and it also jars the camera around in wierd ways\r\n\r\n3) I found the horse (Yak?) to be extremely 'bolty' where the slightest nudge on the d-stick will send it flying off a cliff in situations where finesse is needed.  I've fallen to my death a ton of times (especially on the 'tree' level i'm at now), and it has been frustrating in some cases.\r\n\r\n4) the dodging/rolling mechanics are rough, combined with the relentless onslaught (agression) of the bosses.  I'm guilty of more than a little panic rolling an alhtough i have 200 hours into this game at this point, i feel like i'm still a complete novice at the combat.  Very challenging.   I still have yet to understand how experienced players are able to accurately dodge such a large sequence / variation of attacks on the bosses considering the wide variety of attack actions, timings, and the sheer quantity of bosses.  \r\n\r\n5) being a PC gamer primarily with a background in MMO's and other RPGs, and playing mostly with keyboard/mouse for nearly all of my prior rpgs,  i found the way that your manage your hands/attacks/items to be clumsy.    I figured it was a controller specific issues, but when i looked at what the available keybinds were on a keyboard, it is clear this was a design choice..  You will not be able to simply bind year 'healing flask' to a specific key.  You have to cycle through all the items in that slot and make sure it is selected before you 'use' that item.    I understand why this was  done but damn can be pretty frustrating being run down or using the wrong item (seal instead of shield, etc) based on what was selected.  You really have to plan ahead and when things go badly it is really difficult to recover.   \r\n\r\n6) Finally, it surprised me how many items/skills or spells seemed not be be very balanced.  After dabbling with a strength build (about 50 hours) I rerolled with the desire to really 'learn' the machincs.      I switched to a dex build and tried going strict buckler/dagger --- and struggled quite a lot.   It was very hard to understand why I was getting hit by bosses, as the game doesnt provide much feedback.  Did i mis-time my parry?  Could the move not be parried?   Hard to tell!     I seemed to take lots of damage from margit even when i felt i got the parry off, and the boss was not stunned even when i heard audio cues indicating i pulled the move off.  This was confusing.  After switching to a 2h curved sword, the game instantly got 100x easier.   I also rolled a mage character and again the game was 100x easier.  Intuitively it feels liker the game needs better balance (for the ashes, and for spells), but it really does force you to experiment.\r\n\r\nThis game deserves its reputation of being very hard.    \r\n\r\nIf it sounds like i'm trashing this game, i'm not.    What i've stated above are impressions/areas where i personally struggled as someone not famliar with any fromsoftware games or even any other soulsborne titles.   However,  all that effort has been worth it -\r\n\r\nThe level design(dungeons), settings(locales, themes), graphics(lighting, shadows, etc), lore, encounter design,  music is probably the best i've EVER seen in a game.     And although it is challenging, it has been rewarding.

My favorite thing I would say is the open world environment, the open world is huge with many places to explore and many unique enemies in those places too. I loved exploring the caves and catacombs, probably one of my favorite boss fights in the game was just chilling in a cave, Astel. There is a downside to making a world that big while trying to create a good story though, it gets really confusing especially when you first start this game. It is a very confusing process when you start but just trust that process and just know it won GOTY for a reason, it's a good game with a good story that explains it self when exploring new places. The ending & end game was very worth all the rage & suffering. To point it out, end game was incredibly fun & satisfying. I was mad throughout most of the game, just fighting boss after boss. Once I got to the point where most enemies were pretty easy to kill, I started exploring way more and started enjoying it way more. I felt more powerful as I played the game, one thing this game does really well. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1734955545, "timestamp_updated": 1734955545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183467496": {"recommendationid": "183467496", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975132959", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1106, "playtime_at_review": 761, "last_played": 1735025147}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\r\n-Great colours\r\n-enemy diversity\r\n-runs well\r\n-lots of different ways to play\r\n-interesting plot\r\n-has a map\r\n-can play at your own pace\r\n-fun with friends\r\n-challenging\r\n-memorable bosses\r\n\r\nCons\r\n-no ultrawide support\r\n-engine is a bit dated\r\n-sometimes you need a guide or walkthrough\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734952286, "timestamp_updated": 1734952286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183465200": {"recommendationid": "183465200", "author": {"steamid": "76561199289928509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2063, "playtime_at_review": 1668, "last_played": 1735041602}, "language": "english", "review": "Enter game, die 99 times in a bossfight you are underleveled for, rage quit, try again in 10 minutes. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1734949542, "timestamp_updated": 1734949542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183460099": {"recommendationid": "183460099", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225012700", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2624, "playtime_at_review": 3644, "last_played": 1735031691}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun, there are so many cool weapons to use and so many things to kill.
