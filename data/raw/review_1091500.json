I wish Steam had a sideways thumb...  It isn't a bad game, but it is the very definition of \"overhyped\".\n\nNo, the graphics are not as ground breaking as reviews suggest.  They're good, but nothing new.  The gameplay is what I would call \"fine\", as it's just your typical open world, run errands sort of game.  I spend most of my time talking to people, or answering the stupid phone.  The shooting and most of the movement is weird, like there's a very small delay - especially with crouching, which is about a 50-50 shot if it works first click or not...  Can't comment fully on the storyline, since I'm bogged down in \"wait for this person\", \"call this person\", territory.  So far, I'm not really engaged by it.  The world itself is nicely crafted, but even with all the NPC's running around it just feels \"dead\", as if some computer crafted what they thought the world would look like in order to keep a person happy while they were imprisoned in the matrix.  Which I suppose may be correct, since Night City is essentially society gone wrong due to technology.\n\nWorst part:  Bugs.  Wow, this game must have been miserable when it was first released if people are saying this current version is great when it comes to bugs.  NPC's react very strangely, things pop in and out sometimes, cars spawn upside down, characters fall through the floor or clip into each other, physics objects randomly explode, items clip into each other...  It hasn't been game breaking yet (apart from my car spawning upside down half the time...), but it is absolutely immersion breaking.  Every time I start to get into it finally, some character is walking around on their head, or my car spawns incorrectly, or whatever else, and I'm out again.  I can put up with a bug here and there in a game, but we're talking a couple per minute here.  If this was an early access title or a day-one release waiting on a patch, I'd say it was pretty good for the size of the game.  But 4 years later?\n\nIs the game worth playing?

(Masterpiece)\n\nCyberpunk 2077 has achieved one of the greatest redemption arcs in gaming history. It\u2019s a stunning, immersive RPG that delivers on almost every level\u2014but for me, it\u2019s still missing that elusive something to make it a perfect 10.\n\nWhat I Loved:\n\n    Night City is Unmatched:\n    Night City is the real star of the show. It\u2019s vibrant, chaotic, and alive in a way few game worlds manage to achieve. From the neon-lit alleys of Japantown to the corporate opulence of City Center, every district is meticulously crafted. With improved AI, denser crowds, and enhanced environmental interactions since launch, the city finally feels like the bustling dystopia it was always meant to be.\n\n    Deep, Immersive RPG Gameplay:\n    Cyberpunk 2077 offers incredible freedom in how you approach the game. Whether you prefer hacking your way through systems, stealthily taking down enemies, or going in guns blazing, the gameplay accommodates multiple playstyles. The new updates and DLC bring even more depth to the combat and skill trees, making character builds more engaging than ever.\n\n    Phantom Liberty DLC - A Game-Changer:\n    The Phantom Liberty DLC is not just an expansion\u2014it\u2019s a revitalization. Set in Dogtown, a gritty new district of Night City, it introduces a tense spy-thriller storyline packed with twists, political intrigue, and moral dilemmas. Idris Elba\u2019s performance as Solomon Reed is phenomenal, adding even more gravitas to the stellar voice acting. The DLC also brings significant improvements to the base game, like overhauled perk systems, vehicle combat, and more engaging side quests.\n\n    Memorable Characters and Storytelling:\n    Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s story is rich and emotionally impactful. V and Johnny Silverhand (masterfully voiced by Keanu Reeves) have one of the most compelling dynamics I\u2019ve seen in a game. The game masterfully weaves personal struggles with larger existential questions about identity and humanity. The Phantom Liberty storyline adds even more layers to this narrative brilliance.\n\n    Technical Redemption:\n    At launch, the game was plagued with bugs and performance issues, but it\u2019s now in a state that lives up to its potential. CD Projekt Red has gone above and beyond to address the criticisms, making this one of the best post-launch redemption stories in gaming history.\n\nWhat\u2019s Still Missing:\n\n    Lack of True Player Agency:\n    As much as the game emphasizes choice, the main narrative often funnels you toward specific outcomes. While there are different endings, your decisions throughout the game don\u2019t always feel as impactful as they could be.\n\n    A Sense of Longevity:\n    While the open world is packed with detail, it sometimes feels like a stage rather than a truly living world. Interactions with NPCs and side activities, though improved, still lack the depth to make Night City feel as reactive as it looks.\n\n    Missing That \"Perfect 10\" Factor:\n    For all its brilliance, the game still feels like it\u2019s just short of perfection. Maybe it\u2019s the lack of a revolutionary mechanic that changes the genre, or maybe it\u2019s the way some gameplay elements (like crafting or economy systems) feel secondary. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint, but there\u2019s something intangible that stops it from being the definitive RPG experience.\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is no longer a cautionary tale\u2014it\u2019s a triumph. The Phantom Liberty DLC and continuous updates have elevated the game to masterpiece status, delivering one of the most immersive RPGs of this generation. The world-building, storytelling, and gameplay systems come together in a way that few games manage. However, as polished and engaging as it is, there\u2019s still something missing\u2014a spark or a layer of depth that could make it truly flawless.\n\nPros:\n\n    Night City is a stunning, immersive open world.\n    Deep, versatile gameplay with incredible build options.\n    Masterful storytelling and memorable characters.\n    Phantom Liberty adds an exceptional new storyline and gameplay features.\n    A technical redemption that few games have pulled off.\n\nCons:\n\n    Main narrative choices don\u2019t always feel impactful.\n    Some open-world interactions still feel surface-level.\n    Missing an ineffable \"wow\" factor to make it a perfect 10.\n\nRecommendation:\nCyberpunk 2077 is a must-play, especially in its current state. Whether you\u2019re a fan of immersive worlds, gripping narratives, or deep RPG systems, it delivers on almost every front. The Phantom Liberty DLC is the cherry on top of an already incredible experience. It\u2019s not just a game\u2014it\u2019s a world you\u2019ll want to lose yourself in.", "timestamp_created": 1734638463, "timestamp_updated": 1734638463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708280980587005615", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183184457": {"recommendationid": "183184457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252070106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 277, "playtime_forever": 2479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 970, "playtime_at_review": 1509, "last_played": 1735059876}, "language": "english", "review": "When it first came out, I finished it by watching it on youtube, then I finished the game on another account, but then the DLC came out and I finished it on this account, but I still didn't have it until today.

Melee combat feels horrible and enemies will land hits on you despite being, CD Project Red has also decided to go with the Bethesda path of difficulty. Making enemies bullet sponges that deal a lot of damage. Which doesn't go well with the fact that a lot of enemies can easily get in your face with how fast they are.

People that initially said it was good on release because of buyers remorse are now calling it one of the greatest games ever made because they like the spin-off show.\r\n\r\nObjectively ? The game is still mediocre at best. Not as satisfying to play as GTA5 that is 11 years old now. Driving still feels like you're in an empty box, touch one pebble and see yourself flying. Enemies are still spongy bullet magnets that never die and every fire fight feels like it takes tens of minutes. Stealth just simply doesn't work. Getting spotted by an enemy means every single enemy within the entire fucking building is immediately on alert and attacking you. Some perks just flat out don't work at all, and some don't work some or in the worsy cases most of the time (i.e: multi hacking on enemies via netrunner, or getting out of combat by leaving enemy line of sight). Snipers can shoot you through cover. Most walls are not high enough to hide behind even while crouched (expert merc can't lower his head below cover).\r\n\r\nSubjectively the story is a passive aggressive attack on video game power fantasy. You play this rpg game where you make your own character with the purpose of getting to an ending where you turn into another, \"better\" character. Most endings are dogshit and miserable, can't get out of the old cyberpunk genre cliche of \"sometimes you just don't win\". The endings that aren't just outright the worst possible outcome are at best lukewarm platitudes where you accept a compromise that is still inferior to killing yourself. Your choices don't matter until the absolute very end, but that just reflects on how much this game hates you for having fun with it. Pair all this with the cringe ass slang that's present in every single one of the lines of dialogue and garbage original ideas like forced BD's, net sections, playing from other character's perspectives and other means to waste your time by taking control away from you (in an RPG). This, like \"games\" such as Uncharted, should have been a movie, tho unlike uncharted this would have also been a shit movie.\r\n\r\nWhat about the DLC ? Same shit, but just that little bit worse. Story has the exact same DNA, where you can't really trust anybody, so all the (1) decision that you make at the very end is completely random with no way to tell what you're actually picking. Same convoluted plot. Same disgusting outcome as your reward for going though the hell that is the forced combat sections and boss fights. No, seriously! You HAVE to fight bosses. If you're stealth focused, or a netrunner, you're shit out of luck because you go into combat immediately and hacks do jack shit. You either have to take the difficulty down, or slog through it for 30-40 minutes by hitting barely visible sweet spots for 3 damage with a weapon that hopefully you brought even though you had no intention to use it and have no perks for.\r\n\r\nAll in all, is cyberpunk all bad ? Not really. There's definitely great character interactions. There's some really good side missions. Johnny Silverhand is a pretty good companion even though his character completely ruins all immersion. Are all these things worth playing the game tho ? A definitive no.\r\n\r\nTLDR, Cyberpunk, just like other \"Cinematic\u2122\" \"video games\" like uncharted and tlou, is barely worth calling a video game and them, calling it an RPG, is akin to false advertising. it runs well now after 4 years of tinkering (tho i am running it on a 4090), but the gameplay has barely been fixed to the point of being an inferior GTA clone. The story is dogshit, with a few memorable moments sprinkled in, that culminates in 1 of around 8 miserable outcomes that will leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth. And the hype surrounding it, even now, 4 years later, is nothing more than a combination of buyers remorse from back then and fleeting love for a mediocre show now. Don't waste your time, play Witcher 3 instead.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734819901, "timestamp_updated": 1734819901, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524880766868591309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183364278": {"recommendationid": "183364278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833138814", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2664, "playtime_at_review": 3435, "last_played": 1735048437}, "language": "english", "review": "The true Labour of Love. \n57 hours in and still so many customizations to discover.

I can't comment too much on the action and gameplay aspects because I'm really bad at it and blundered my way through on the easiest difficulty without making use of pretty much any of the cybernetic enhancements and upgrade trees, but I can say I had fun with the game and it's clear that there's a lot here for you to sink your teeth into if you enjoy first-person shooters. What really made me fall in love with this game was its presentation and writing. Night City is like no other video game world, so massive and messy and convoluted that you'll never learn the whole of it, and driving through its streets past the countless neon signs and towering skyscrapers is the most immersive experience I've ever had in a video game. This beautiful city serves as the stage for some of the best writing video games have to offer. While the main story is quite impressive in its own right, what really caught my attention were the numerous side quests full of complex characters and difficult choices. I really felt like I came to know some of these characters during my time in Night City, and when I left I felt as though I had made my mark on the world around me. It's these important side quests that I believe are the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 because they feel much more intimate and human than a lot of the main story, which sometimes tries too hard to be cool and 'cyberpunky' while losing sight of the human tale underneath. Still, when paired with the fantastic side quests, the narrative is ultimately what left a lasting impression on me. Cyberpunk 2077 may have launched as a broken and incomplete garbage fire, but through the developers' constant hard work, it has transformed into an undeniable masterpiece of modern game design, mixing finely-tuned gameplay with writing that will rip your heart out of your chest and wrapping it up in some of the most impressive art and graphics that gaming has to offer.

It\u2019s gritty, gorgeous, and full of life (and a fair bit of death).

Whether I\u2019m hacking into enemies\u2019 brains, blasting my way through gangs, or stealthily sneaking past guards, the game gives me endless ways to approach every scenario.\r\nThe progression system is deeply satisfying, letting you truly shape your version of V.

It\u2019s alive, pulsing with neon lights, shady characters, and hidden stories. Walking through its streets feels like stepping into a sci-fi novel, where every corner holds a secret or an encounter.\r\n\r\nThe attention to detail is mind-blowing\u2014from the grime in back alleys to the gleaming skyscrapers in Corpo Plaza. It\u2019s a city of contrasts, and I can\u2019t help but get lost in its beauty and chaos.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Story - Deep and Personal[/h2]\r\nThe main storyline is gripping, with emotional highs and lows that left me speechless. The side quests, though, are where the game truly shines. These aren\u2019t filler\u2014they\u2019re intricate, meaningful stories that expand on Night City\u2019s lore and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nEvery choice feels impactful, and the game doesn\u2019t shy away from moral ambiguity. It\u2019s not about doing the \u201cright thing\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about surviving in a world that doesn\u2019t care about you.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Highlights - What Makes It Stand Out[/h2]\r\n\r\nDeep, complex characters that feel human.\r\nA visually stunning world that\u2019s as immersive as it is massive.\r\nCustomization options that let you truly make V your own.\r\nEndless replayability, thanks to the branching storylines and builds.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Cons - The Shadows in the Neon[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe AI can feel a little predictable in certain encounters.\r\nSome features, like the open-world police system, feel underdeveloped.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Final Thoughts - A Modern Sci-Fi Masterpiece[/h2]\r\nCyberpunk 2077 is ambitious, daring, and unforgettable. After 125 hours, I\u2019m still finding new things to love about this game.
