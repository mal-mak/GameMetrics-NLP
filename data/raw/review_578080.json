Better version of Day-Z with all the added fun. Takes a while to get a handle on the weapon handling, and aiming but once you do it's rewarding. There's nothing better than running solo play and wiping 4 man's daily. Definitely a recommended download. Plus Battle-passes are usually $4-$9 so cant complain.

While my current setup allows for 60-70 fps on average on very low settings with a FOV of 95 & native resolution, the performance is not optimal for competitive gameplay.\n\nPUBG is widely regarded as one of the most realistic battle royale games. It distinguishes itself with its emphasis on tactical gameplay and strategy, providing a more immersive experience compared to other titles in the genre. With a diverse array of weapons, attachments, and maps, each match offers a unique experience. The game encourages players to think strategically, manage resources effectively, and plan their actions carefully.\n\nAchieving proficiency in PUBG demands significant effort and expertise. Players must familiarize themselves with the mechanics of various weapons, gain a deep understanding of the maps, and master the use of utilities such as grenades.
