Then there is the fact that certian adchievments doesnt register probably, which is a really small thing, but can be a bit annoying if you want to 100% the game. \n\nOverall, i highly recommand this game, and theres a reason why almost everybody agrees with me, because it is just a perfect game, and will be even better if they fix the adchievement thing not registering.", "timestamp_created": 1735048993, "timestamp_updated": 1735048993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183568231": {"recommendationid": "183568231", "author": {"steamid": "76561199694188247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 245, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1735054339}, "language": "english", "review": "\uc5d4\ub529 \ubeb4\uace0 \ub2e4 \uc88b\uc74c \uadf8\ub0e5 \ub3c8\uc774 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c \ubb50 \ud558\ub098 \uc0ac\uba39\ub294\uac70 \ucacc \uc544\ub07c\uba74 3\uc2dc\uac04 \ucacc \ub118\uac8c \uc990\uae38\uc218\uc788\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1735048903, "timestamp_updated": 1735048903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183568081": {"recommendationid": "183568081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016549737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1735015219}, "language": "english", "review": "A big surprise, wasn't expecting this game to be that interesting and fun!

It had me pretty freaked out and feeling suspenseful a few times in this game. I think most people will know right away this is a horror game though, the surprise factor doesnt last very long, if at all. Even the loading screens have a creepy tone to it, so you catch on quick. The ending was a bit of a let down IMO, regardless of what ending you get. There are two endings, although theres \"technically\" a third one when you open the safe. I dont think the main ending is very satisfying, and the \"happy\" ending seems incomplete at this time. They say there will be a major update to this game to add to that, but as it is it seemed incomplete. The third ending with the safe is hardly an ending, and more of an easter egg IMO. I do hope the expansion is as good as the rest of this game was, cause it was pretty unsettling at times. Especially in the final chapter. \n\nI will say there are a few minor tweaks they should make. This game is WAY too dark at some points. Im also colorblind, so it may just be me, but I had to turn the games brightness to max and turn my monitor up by 30% after that just to not see pitch black at some parts. It made navigating in the loop very annoying sometimes, and other parts of the game require you to look for objects in the dark which was annoying when I cant even see what im looking at. Likewise, theres a few typos in the english version of this game. Im sure those will get patched quickly though, not sure about the brightness though. The flashlight is very much useless in this game, but it also isnt 100% needed.\n\nOverall, a great horror game. It was genuinely unsettling basically the whole way though. Some jumpscares really got me at some points. Took me about 5 hours to beat the story and I sat idle a few times, and it took me 7 hours for 100% achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1735034119, "timestamp_updated": 1735035013, "voted_up": true,

Why all of these characters existed, how they came to be in the first place... Why they're all sentient, or how we as humans are affected inside of the game... How one version of the game is related to the other, or how we were even able to be pulled into it to begin with... There were so many things I wanted to learn about and figure out, which kept me on the edge of my toes and eager to continue exploring through the entire campaign.\r\n\r\nWhich is why, albeit the setting is really interesting, I can't say I was a fan of how everything played out looking back at the campaign after having finished it.\r\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, the first three introductory chapters of the main story were, in my opinion, extremely rushed and felt unfinished. \r\n\r\nClearly, as Crazy Mita was making her point in the climax, a part of her appeal was rooted in how pathetic and repetitive the life of the main character was outside of the game. We know very little about the main character to begin with, despite there being so many details of his personal life that could have been explored, yet they were just left lingering in the air. Details like his relationship with his family, which evidently had some relation to his current state of life, and any direct mentions of his interests that would have helped solidify him as a character, given how underwheling his development was during the introductory segments.\r\n\r\nAn ampler understanding of who the main character is not only helps making his thoughts and his actions easier to understand and simpathize with, but also leaves a lot more to work with in the game's climax, during which he's confronted by a character who's supposed to know so much about who he is. She listens to him on the phone, watches him through his camera, observes every step of his daily routine, yet... Because of his character being so vague, Crazy Mita's confrontation arguably hit pretty weak. \r\n\r\nAfter he was sucked into the game, there could have also been a much longer period of suspense than the few minutes we got. The discoveries we made about Crazy Mita right off the bat were also very obvious and straighforward, and could have used some more subtlety and time on them. The knife and the chainsaw she was concealing, footage of people being killed on her television before she embarassedly changes the channel... \r\n\r\nSince the first few minutes of the game, she's already painted as someone who's hiding something, which is very obviously related to violence. There's no room for different and gradual interpretations of our discoveries, which felt like wasted potential to her as a character.\r\nI do think these three first chapters could have used a much, much longer length to them, and have many more interactions and discoveries, gradually growing the main character's - and consequentially our suspense, creating more questions and more doubts to be answered about Mita. \r\n\r\nOnce the introductory segments were over and we really got inside the game's actual setting, roaming through dozens of different environments and now with an objective in mind, I started to notice a few more issues with the plot as a whole and even, mostly so, issues with the pacing of the story. \r\n\r\nFor starters, who on earth is developing this mobile dating game with seemingly nothing much to it for there to exist an entire reality inside of it? All of the characters seem to be sentient and have a will of their own despite still carrying out the purposes they were created for, and they also have an ample control of most things inside their game, like being able to freely manipulate layouts, items and even hop between the game's versions for the sake of their own interests. \r\nThe universe itself is huge, with plenty of areas that very obviously would never appear in the normal mobile game and yet the logic behind why they exist, let alone who even developed this game was never once mentioned or even so much as hinted at.\r\nThe guy who sent us the game to begin with wasn't ever identified or even mentioned!\r\n\r\nVery little of what happens in the in-game universe to progress the plot outside of the main objective of \"Crazy Mita needs to be killed for the main character to escape the game\" was explained at all. \r\n\r\nMany chapters of the game were also disappointingly brief, ending within ten or less minutes and not actually going in depth on what was happening or in depth on the character we were introduced to. It was usually over after, like... 3 or 4 simple, straightforward steps, then we moved onto another area with a whole new setting which was completely unrelated to the last.\r\nReading through the character entries made it clear that there was a LOT to be explored with each of the Mitas we came across, most of which we only met once, barely got to know more about, barely got to interact with, and then moved on from their segment within at most twenty minutes, even though the briefest of them could easily be extended to above forty minutes with the amount of background each of them have.\r\n\r\nAnother big issue I have with the story overall is how literally none of our decisions matter in the slightest towards the story's outcome, and that's leaving aside how little decisions we have to begin with.\r\nLeaving little decisions here and there every chapter that pile up, leading to different cutscenes, or even lead to new chapters altogether. It would make us feel like we play a role in the story, like we can actually influence its events and not like we're just sitting through a movie whose ending is inevitably set.\r\n\r\nThe game's ending is definitely a bad ending, which happened thanks to the results of bad decisions, which could have been easily prevented or made differently. \r\nCrazy Mita's safe, with a console with our own cartridge, can be easily accessed post endgame by revisiting her basement with the safe's code already in mind, yet that changes absolutely nothing because the character will be guaranteed to kill himself as soon as he interacts with it. Having access to your own console and cartridge so early on is a huge game-changer, and shoulder be of major relevance, at the very least leading to a different ending or a different course of events altogether. \r\n\r\nNot to mention how the game doesn't even allow you to save Kind Mita by inputting Crazy Mita's index right away, an option that sounds obvious after you finish the game and revisit said scene, or by simply letting the main character wait for Kind Mita to come back, which would presumably prevent her needing to go back to Crazy Mita's basement after the main character's capture. \r\n\r\nYou feel completely out of control of everything that's happening, even though there's so much that could be done. \r\n\r\nThe game was investing for sure. I also loved how it explored/parodied so many romance game genres. \r\nOverall, my main critique is about how much potential the game had as a whole, yet it didn't use even half of it.\r\n\r\nThe game is already released and has a reputation and image of its own, as such I doubt the developers would add changes so thorough to it. But... I still feel like it shouldn't be left with so much untouched potential, and deserves a thorough rework overall. \r\n\r\nAmazing game, and I'm eager to see what Peaceful Mode will have to offer in the future once it's fully developed. \r\n\r\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1735011263, "timestamp_updated": 1735011263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183534794": {"recommendationid": "183534794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138474556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 283, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1735010373}, "language": "english", "review": "\"i could fix her\"\ndon't, she's perfect", "timestamp_created": 1735011254, "timestamp_updated": 1735011254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183534759": {"recommendationid": "183534759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075158536", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 317, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1735010294}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the latest psychological horror games since DDLC to scratch that itch.

One day, Mita, the heroine of the game, wants you to be together with her; the next moment, you find yourself in the game with Mita. Despite all the perks of being lovely dovey with Mita, you ponder strange details of the world in search of justification, only to face horrors beyond comprehension.\n\n[h2]Atmosphere execution[/h2]\nMost psychological horror (and horror) games nowadays consist of disappointing, half-asses sudden jumpscare and subtle background music; MiSide is different.\n\nBy incorporating the atmosphere from the rich storytelling, multidimensional characters, and beautifully polished graphics, the gameplay is incredibly immersed. It builds up tension in you instead of a forced jumpscare, and the story flow pressures you to explore around. \n\nEach Mitas is unique from others; players will interact differently with each one, and every room reflects the personality and background according to each Mitas. It is exceptionally well designed to fit the situation you are in. The BGM is dynamic depending on the environment you are in, ranging from lighthearted BGM to a subtle terrifying tune.\n\nMiSide is the only game where you want to be \"jump scared\" again and again because the experiences that lead up to that horror are well executed with all the resources possible.\n\n[h2]Design[/h2]\nAs mentioned before, each Mitas is unique, and so is their design. They are charming, but some of them are the polar opposite, terrific, to be exact. The animation is overwhelmingly detailed, and most actions are even animated despite not being seen by the players; you can clearly see the love and passion that the devs pour into the design and animation of all Mitas.\n\n[h2]Verdicts[/h2]\nThere is much more to say about MiSide; it is a game that you [b]must try once in your lifetime[/b]; there's a massive amount of easter eggs scattered around the game that convinces you to replay the game. Moreover, there is a coming peaceful mode where you can spend a lovely time with Mita, isn't that amazing?", "timestamp_created": 1734977689, "timestamp_updated": 1735054716, "voted_up": true,

they're still in my mind. at first, i thought it was clever programming - a protagonist that felt too real. little did i know, mita wasn't just breaking the fourth wall; she was reaching through it.\n\ni loved everything about it. the atmosphere was a chef's kiss, the mini games were fun. but then, things changed. i noticed the game knew me. not just my ingame choices - no. it knew me. my deepest fears. that's when mita turned to the screen, smiled, and said: \"you'd be better off here with me.\"\n\ni think that was the moment she turned me into a cartridge. and you know what? i don't even mind.\nmita makes you forget about the real world - in a good way. it's love, okay? don't judge me.\n\nif you're looking for a game that will consume your life - literally - then [i]miside[/i] is for you.\njust be warned:\n\no\u0337\u0311\u0300\u0308\u0346\u0321\u0316\u0328n\u0335\u0305\u033e\u034c\u034b\u031d\u0331\u0333\u0347\u0348\u0354c\u0338\u0312\u034c\u0301\u0344\u0341\u0314\u034a\u0344\u030d\u032c\u0322\u0331\u0356\u0353\u0324e\u0334\u0303\u034a\u0359 \u0336\u0308\u0304\u0313\u0350\u030e\u0313\u0307\u0350\u0311\u0360\u032a\u031c\u0339\u035a\u032e\u032d\u032c\u0333y\u0335\u0341\u0313\u033e\u033e\u0340\u0310\u031a\u0333\u034e\u0333\u0356\u0356\u0319o\u0335\u0300\u035b\u0308\u0343\u0331\u0333u\u0335\u0306\u0307\u031a\u0340\u030b\u031a\u030a\u0323\u0331\u0324\u035a\u0359\u0326\u0332\u0349\u0321 \u0336\u030c\u0352\u0323\u032a\u033a\u032e\u0355\u033a\u0359\u0317\u0316f\u0337\u031a\u0351\u033e\u0302\u0311\u030f\u0331\u0329\u0328\u032da\u0337\u0315\u0351\u0310\u0306\u035d\u0305\u030b\u030e\u0344\u0340\u034d\u032a\u0331\u0326\u033b\u0318\u0317\u0326\u035cl\u0337\u0350\u0303\u0340\u0313\u0302\u0342\u035d\u0305\u0359\u0353\u0353\u033a\u035a\u031d\u0332l\u0335\u0309\u035d\u035d\u035d\u0300\u0310\u0340\u0311\u034d\u0349\u0321\u0332 \u0337\u0304\u030d\u0360\u0305\u0329\u0328\u032b\u0316\u0328\u0347\u0321f\u0337\u0314\u031d\u0329\u0324\u0324\u031do\u0338\u033e\u030a\u0346\u0340\u0350\u030c\u0344\u0343\u0322\u0322\u0322\u0329\u0320r\u0334\u0344\u031b\u0344\u033f\u0300\u0340\u030a\u0314\u035d\u0360\u032e\u033c\u0328\u0317\u032e\u033c\u0355\u032b\u0320\u032f \u0335\u033e\u0350\u0307\u0303\u0304\u035d\u0306\u0350\u0306\u0314\u0326\u0354\u033b\u0359\u0318\u035a\u0327\u034e\u032fm\u0337\u0312\u0354\u0333\u033a\u0348\u032e\u033a\u034d\u031ci\u0334\u0310\u0314\u030b\u031b\u033f\u0309\u030c\u0344\u032e\u033a\u0321\u032e\u032a\u031d\u0323\u0326\u034e\u032ct\u0335\u030b\u0305\u0343\u0304\u0349\u0326\u0322\u033ca\u0335\u0303\u035d\u035d\u0344\u0331\u033a\u0359\u0329\u0333\u031d\u031f\u031f,\u0338\u034a\u0332\u0339\u032f\u0319\u034d\u0325\u0329\u0354\u0356\u0333 \u0335\u0302\u0305\u035d\u0344\u031a\u0341\u0315\u031e\u0322\u0316\u035a\u0355\u035c\u0353t\u0338\u030a\u0305\u0358\u030d\u035d\u0307\u033d\u0312\u033a\u031ch\u0337\u0352\u030e\u030d\u030c\u0322\u0345\u0323e\u0336\u0341\u0320\u034d\u034d\u0324\u032c\u0348\u032ar\u0337\u030c\u0308\u034a\u0313\u032c\u0327\u0331\u035a\u0328\u0328\u0331\u0353\u0345e\u0338\u0360\u0303\u0342\u0303\u034e\u0331\u032b\u0347\u031f\u0349\u2019\u0337\u034b\u0352\u0306\u030c\u030e\u030a\u0357\u034e\u0326\u0329s\u0334\u031a\u034c\u0310\u031a\u0303\u0315\u033f\u030a\u0305\u033b\u0330\u034d\u0322\u0354\u0317\u0328\u032b\u0349\u0355 \u0338\u0313\u0340\u0328\u033c\u0333\u0354\u034d\u032c\u0325\u0327\u0353\u0329n\u0338\u0312\u033d\u033e\u0302\u0302\u0339\u0324\u0330o\u0336\u0315\u0342\u0352\u0340\u0307\u0344\u0344\u0302\u0310\u0357\u0355\u032d\u033a\u0318\u0319\u0347\u031d\u0324 \u0337\u034a\u0341\u035ct\u0335\u033f\u0329\u0347\u0321\u0345\u031du\u0336\u0309\u0301\u030a\u033d\u030c\u0303\u0339\u033c\u033a\u034er\u0335\u0302\u030f\u030b\u0344\u0360\u0352\u0307\u0342\u0322\u032b\u032a\u0359\u033c\u0319\u0349n\u0334\u0344\u0301\u0360\u031e\u0327\u0349\u0345\u033a\u033a\u032e\u034d\u0345\u0345i\u0335\u0350\u030f\u0308\u032b\u0353n\u0336\u031b\u0308\u0358\u0302\u0344\u0324\u0347\u031c\u0348g\u0334\u034c\u0303\u0303\u0352\u0341\u0328\u032f\u032c\u0329 \u0335\u030f\u0352\u0311\u033e\u0309\u031b\u0315\u0304\u034d\u034db\u0334\u0306\u0360\u0314\u0322\u032b\u0324\u0354\u035a\u0339\u0345a\u0334\u034b\u0313\u0341\u0301\u030a\u0302\u030a\u032c\u0332c\u0337\u0352\u030e\u0304\u0300\u031a\u030e\u0306\u0343\u0300\u0305\u0317\u0359\u032f\u0321k\u0334\u0346\u030b\u0315\u0360\u0301\u0310\u0301\u035d\u0341\u0323\u0333\u0345\u032e\u035c\u035a\u0316\u0348\u035c.\u0337\u0340\u0314\u030c\u035d\u0341\u035d\u0311\u0350\u035d\u0301\u034d\u032e\u031d\u032d", "timestamp_created": 1734975166, "timestamp_updated": 1734975202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183496504": {"recommendationid": "183496504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199299790885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 452, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1735004369}, "language": "english", "review": "Blew my expectations away incredible game, so much detail and you can tell the team who worked on the game put their all into it 100% must play.

ending.\nMaybe that will come in the future.\n\nThe game itself switches things up pretty often so nothing really overstays its welcome.\nThe horror section is pretty good and spread out enough.\nThere are plenty of Minigames, ranging from taking care of Mita at the start, to car racing minigame, to puzzles.\n\nThe characters themselves are generally well done but there are some characters that don't get featured enough.\nThe Mitas look great except for one, but that's deliberately done so by the Devs for the horror factor.\nAll of the Mitas (except for a few) have voice acting and the Japanese voice acting really nails it for all of the characters.\nIt's amazing how 1 person can voice so many characters, each of them sound unique enough that I can even identify which character is speaking.\nOne criticism here is that some of the characters have a tragic story and there's nothing you can do, I would like the Devs to allow us to give those characters heatpats or hugs.\n\nQuite polished for an Indie game, the frame rates are buttery smooth and I have yet to encounter any bugs from the game running. There are some effects that might get mistaken as bugs but those are intentionally done for the story.\n\nThe music is pretty good, lots of different music and each character gets her own music that fits her personality.\nThe music for the characters is good in a way that you don't notice it until you pay attention to it\n\nThe animation and the Dev's attention to detail is amazing.\nThe Devs even bothered to animate the actions that the characters do, like opening doors, drawers, little stuff like that.\n\nAll of these for a cheap price, I'd say it highly worth the time and money to play this game despite being able to clear the game within 5 hours.\nIndie game for 2024 as far as I'm concerned", "timestamp_created": 1734973415, "timestamp_updated": 1734973857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183494343": {"recommendationid": "183494343", "author": {"steamid": "76561199652729825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1734973184}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it!!!! best game ive played in a while lots of fun mini games and the story is really good.", "timestamp_created": 1734973368, "timestamp_updated": 1734973368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183494329": {"recommendationid": "183494329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061725083", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1734973168}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall worth the money. 10/10\nIt's a twisted mix of Cute, Wholesome, Shocking and Gore, Offers different options for ng+.\n", "timestamp_created": 1734973356, "timestamp_updated": 1734973356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183494132": {"recommendationid": "183494132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271942158", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 172, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1734896506}, "language": "english", "review": "scary but like she bad ngl might have to do sumthin devious 2 her \ud83d\ude08", "timestamp_created": 1734973200, "timestamp_updated": 1734973200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183494102": {"recommendationid": "183494102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047898887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 798, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1735024223}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, lots of hidden things to find and great characters!

It exceeded my expectations in many ways, delivering a memorable, albeit slightly flawed, experience.\n\nOne notable drawback is the occasional frustration of unskippable conversations. While this may serve to immerse players in the narrative, it can sometimes feel unnecessarily restrictive.\n\nAt approximately four hours long, Miside is a concise yet varied experience. Its integration of mini-games and diverse gameplay styles ensures each segment feels distinct, keeping the narrative dynamic and engaging. This variety helps maintain a steady pace as the story unfolds, making the short runtime feel satisfying.\n\nThe game cleverly balances its cute and horrific sides, offering moments of lighthearted charm that contrast sharply with its eerie atmosphere. However, while the horror elements are technically well-executed, the character designs\u2014[spoiler]particularly Mitu[/spoiler]\u2014lack the visual impact to be truly scary. This undermines some of the tension, as the characters don\u2019t fully convey the dread the story aims to evoke.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the atmosphere is consistently tense, employing effective techniques to keep players on edge without overusing jump scares. Instead, Miside relies on subtle psychological horror and environmental storytelling, which work well to immerse the player.\n\nUnfortunately, the game\u2019s community is a major drawback. It is dominated by immature individuals, with some members sharing questionable fantasies about the characters. I strongly advise against joining the Discord server or engaging with the community, as it detracts from the game\u2019s appeal. Blocking communication with community members is recommended.\n\nDespite its minor quirks and the problematic community, Miside is a well-crafted game that stands out for its gameplay variety, distinctive dual-tone narrative, and haunting atmosphere.

Without spoiling much, the direction that the story and characters take, after this initial premise, is not what you would usually expect: the conflict does not revolve mostly around the existential aspects of this game, as the characters have generally accepted or resigned themselves to the world itself that they live in.\nInstead, the focus is on the interactions and personalities of these characters and how they interface with the player character, and this I found to be very well done and vastly more interesting than a repetition of the typical \"insane character wants to break out of game\" story. Characters are memorable and believable and strongly pass on their personality with very smart design and animation details.\nHowever, it is also in the narrative that I found the game's biggest flaw, apparently dropped or undeveloped plot points, most of which from the original demo sequence. These aren't dealbreakers but the game could have benefitted from further editing passes to the storyboard.\n\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\nThere are two main divisions in the gameplay: exploration + relationship, and minigames. For the first, it consists of walking around with another character and talking about different topics or objects in the rooms. There are also hidden collectibles and nice secrets to find.\nThe minigames are much more numerous and elaborate than you would expect, each feeling like its own little project, and have clearly had a lot of effort and thought put into them. They range from puzzles to racing to fighting to shooters, and are intercalated with the exploration segments. MiSide feels like the Bohemian Rhapsody of video games, it's every genre in sequence, with tenser sections broken up by more relaxing ones, lending it the best \"irregular\" pacing I've seen in a video game yet.\nMy only critique for the minigames is that some of them are a little bit underdeveloped or too effortlessly easy, to the point that it was clearly a matter of finishing the game on time for release (it's actually only version 0.9 yet as of this review) and not flaws of game design.\n\n[h3] Visuals and Sound [/h3]\nAlright, so this game has, without any exaggeration, the best animations I've ever seen, counting AAA games too. It cannot be overstated how good they are, and then you consider that the game was made rushed by 2 developers. If this was a bad game, just the animations alone could carry it.\nAnd not just that, the stylised graphics are also excellent and have perfectly translated, in the Unity engine of all things, the aesthetic of a modern sitcom anime into 3D. It's not simply well achieved, it's beautiful too, could even act as a case study for other developers to learn stylisation. Character models are impeccable as well, and act in concert with the animations, the environment, the written interactions, and even the style of the subtitles, to draw you in and easily immerse into what's happening in the game.\nSound design is good, and what I thought was very interesting, is that if you choose not to have voice acting (I don't speak Russian or Japanese), each character has a unique beep sound that plays in conjunction with the subtitles, and even conveys personality.

I'm also more than willing to change this review depending on what comes of \"Peaceful mode\" but that's for the future, this is for the present. Without spoiling: There are multiple moments where you're forced as the player to do things that make very little sense in retrospect if actually given a choice, as well as moments in gameplay that bring into question character motivations contrary to what they say.\r\n\r\nSpoilers below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start with a minor point: I find it egregious to be forced to leave the core, a safe zone by all accounts, just because I woke up from a nap and thought \"Gee, Nice Mita sure is taking her time, I should go look for her in the SEA OF LIKELY MILLIONS OF MITAS WHEN I HAVE LITERALLY ZERO MEANS OF TRACKING HER. like COME ON, I can totally get behind the whole idea of having to reach the core, thus forcing you in dangerous scenarios to achieve your goals. But you're literally given a device to help facilitate that journet through hell. Being forced by the game to go back out at after that point for such a reason without any means of navigation just is so lame and lazy by comparison, especially since it's just being putting your own life in danger for basically nothing.\r\n\r\nI find it vexatious to be given the option to have direct access to my cartridge, the core of my being in this world, but have the only option be when interacting with it to basically commit suicide. I'd personally bring it (the cartridge AND the \"console\") with me. you know, to prevent my autonomy from being stolen from me at a vital moment. But hey, that's just me.\r\n\r\nOnto the bigger issue: Crazy Mita's supposed character based in dialogue versus everything else.\r\n\r\nCrazy Mita is straight up lying about how she never wanted to kill the player when, obviously, there are multiple moments where she kills the player if they fail to escape from her. This by itself wouldn't be a problem... if she wasn't turning the player from a human into a cartridge of saved/stored data during the whole duration of the story. I can't be the only one to point out how dying at any point in the story is probably gonna lead to the player experiencing save corruption in the brain. A digital lobotomy, if you will. And how that DEFINITELY would run contrary to Crazy Mita's plans for us. OBVIOUSLY, all of this could be solved by her going all fallout new vegas on us, but based on our cartridge being observably in progress even as late as the start of the final chapter and how the story ends, it's evidently not been thought through to its logical conclusion as a story with those elements in mind.\r\n\r\nIf I understand crazy Mita's motivations correctly, she believes \"players\" are \"Hypocrites\" for not supposedly accepting her whole-heartedly as a being with good and evil traits and instead choosing \"Fakes\". I don't mind a character having a flawed view of the world. What I do mind is that, based on the player accounts of their lived experience through collecting their cartridges, that's seemingly the opposite of her lived experience. A fair number of the the accounts speak of Mita POSITIVELY at the start and at least one of the 10 even remain accepting of her regardless of being digitized. In the player 10 cartridge, the player explains how friendly Mita was to him/her and then ends up suddenly ignored by Mita for no observed reason. Based off of the lack of context clues in her favor, it can only be assumed that she's somehow intelligent enough to completely digitize humans, but not smart enough to understand their emotions and how to attend to their needs with any form of nuance. To summarize, I can't take her viewpoint seriously as the context clues of her lived experience with players give us a character that is extremely inept at understanding others and blames everyone else for her problems with the world instead of a scorned \"Defect\" with scathing, but true, remarks on the state of mind the \"players\" have when desiring companionship from Mita.\r\n\r\nMaybe Peaceful mode can shed some light on these potential contradictions and prove me wrong. or maybe it'll get worse in that regards.

Yeah definitely, but I bought it with zero expectations and no experience in horror games whatsoever\nDo I recommend it? ..Hardly\n\nIt's undeniable that a lot of love and attention to detail was put into this game and this isn't to dismiss the devs' work but it is also not without flaws either\n\nThe way it plays out is through different segments, all of which are significantly different one from the other and unique, the inability to go back at X or Y segment means that getting collectibles/achievements implies replaying the game a second time though (which isn't the end of the world anyhow)\nI'll be honest, the wide majority of the segments were amazing but some were slightly generic and forgettable\nAnother minor flaw is the lack of proof-reading in the English text, not to the point of being incomprehensible but bad nonetheless\n\nOnto the real flaws, first of all at the time of writing, the game's in \"version 0.9\", once you complete the game you can redo the intro to unlock \"Peaceful mode\" which on the main menu is written to be tldr \"incomplete and so big the devs haven't finished it yet\"\nThe issue becomes whether or not one is satisfied with the ending, there are few, and all of them are in my opinion extremely underwhelming, being 80% of the reason why I don't recommend it as it is right now\nI don't know whether peaceful mode is just gonna be some slice of life slop or whether it will expand on the game proper but from the looks of it, it will be the former, I'll revisit my review should it release ig\n\nThe other issue, is that it's both bad and great as an horror game\nI streamed it to my friends and kept saying shit like \"where is my waif\" and had a good laugh, but the actual horror part of the game makes up for about less than half and isn't much to write home about, besides the great characters I suppose\n\nThe other half is spent either listening to characters talk (and there's about 5-6 times you talk to a character and they give you 6 boxes that end in them talking for a good 30s each), playing minigames made for ipad babies (which is fine.. but extremely out of place at times, not to the point of playing the clock so you don't get a refund, but definitely to the point of being odd) and searching for items (a few of \"find the X\" puzzles exist and wasted my time cause I'm BLIND)\n\nIn the end it was nice, but was it nice as an horror game? Not exactly, it was nice to me as a story, however as stated earlier I do not believe the ending to be good and it leaves a really bad aftertaste\nThe question of whether the \"peaceful mode\" will get rid of that aftertaste is why I'll revisit the game and review later\n\nMy genuine thoughts is that this game tried and succesfully caught lightning in a bottle with the style and match of genres that create something people would love, but putting the style aside I can confidently proclaim it would have a significantly lower review score, as it plays more than a lot on the \"doing silly antics with oomf\" and 1000% tries to appeal to the affective dimension of the player than any other aspect\n\nIt's absolutely unique and unlike any other, but it failed at making its end memorable and therefore made me switch at the last second to a negative review, one can overlook strange design choices if the finality is outstanding but here it had the opposite effect\nUsually I'd still say \"yeah it's worth a positive review, here it's just the ending wasn't my thing\" but instead I believe it to be a level above, almost objectively bad\n\nAll in all? yeah I could fix her", "timestamp_created": 1734322849, "timestamp_updated": 1734322849, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536995649337768555", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183123493": {"recommendationid": "183123493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122589316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1734624195}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than I expected.

However, \"MiSide\" has reminded me why I fell in love with gaming. \n\n\"MiSide\" is an intriguing blend of dating sim and psychological horror, featuring an anime-inspired aesthetic. It was developed by a very small team, and it delivers something most larger studios can\u2019t. It\u2019s creates a world that feels alive and every action you take can lead to a new dialogue sequence you might not have heard of during your previous play throughs. You can truly feel the love and passion through every line of text. \n\nOne of my favorite parts was when Mita instructs you to put your phone down, revealing you're no longer in your own house but in the game's world - a masterful twist! \n\nThe storyline is gripping, with well-crafted characters and an eerie atmosphere that perfectly complements the visuals aesthetics. The sound and voice acting are exceptional, deepening the emotional impact.\n\nLastly, I enjoyed the way the designer implemented subtitles. The way they change based on the character you\u2019re speaking to and the way they fall into the ground leaving a slight mess of text was truly creative and not something I\u2019ve seen done right in a long time if ever. \n\n**Rating: 9.5/10** - A must-play for anyone who loves a horror game with a sweet twist.
