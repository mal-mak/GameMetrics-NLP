I played both games multiples times in the past, it's one of my favorite games ever!!\n\nAfter playing the DOS series I had a feeling that Larian would deliver something amazing and they did. This game is a masterpiece, a work of art!!! I loved the full turn-based combat, it's challenging but rewarding. Each battle is unique and requires strategy even though there are multiple ways to win the combat.\n\nThe story is deep, this is one of the best writing I have seen in a video game.

Just beat the campaign on Tactician difficulty after 170 hours of gameplay (although 10 or so hours of that were me being AFK) as a half-elf fire sorcerer. If you're a completionist like me and have to explore every possible area of every map and try to do every single side quest, this incredible game has at least 100 hours of gameplay, more like 150+. What really makes Baldur's Gate 3 such a masterpiece is the presentation - the story is fantastic, interesting and full of twists and turns. The characters are some of the best in any game ever made with excellent voice acting - you will be emotionally attached to many of these characters. The world is interesting - full of secrets, magic and mayhem. The presentation is easily a 10 out of 10. The gameplay is almost perfect as well - the combat systems are engaging, fun and require strategy to triumph in battle. Exploring is fun and there are many secrets to find. Leveling up your characters and finding/buying better and better gear is a joy. Your dialog choices make a real difference on what happens in the game which makes things more exciting. The only real complaints I have about the gameplay are first that the NPCs are painfully dumb. You can kill a nearby NPC in another room as long as you're out of sight, then their friend/associate NPC will walk into the room with the corpse and not even react most of the time. Also the NPCs will be standing in the same spots and having the same conversations over and over for basically the entire game. Sure this makes sense for vendors, but for a group of random people to be standing in the same spot multiple days in the row talking about the same stuff is a bit illusion breaking. While I understand it would have been an immense task to make the NPCs more natural with their behaviors, it would have made the game feel more realistic... maybe there's a mod that fixes that. Second, since the battles are turn based, if there are a good amount of enemies (10+) the battles can sometimes take a long time to finish. I fought some battles that lasted for an hour. In some ways it makes the battles feel more epic, and being turn based does mean more strategy is involved, but sometimes I found myself thinking \"this battle would have taken 5 minutes instead of 1 hour if this game wasn't turn based.\" Still overall I enjoyed the turn based combat as I haven't played many turn based games in the past. Besides the dumb NPC behavior and sometimes exhausting length of the turn based battles and some other minor complaints that aren't even worth mentioning, the gameplay in Baldur's Gate 3 is still fantastic and I would rate the gameplay a 9.5 out of 10. With a 10 out of 10 for presentation, that makes my overall rating for Baldur's Gate 3 a 9.75 out of 10. An absolutely incredible experience in gaming that I will never forget. \r\n\r\nIf you are an experienced/advanced/expert gamer, I would absolutely recommend playing Tactician difficulty, because even on Tactician I didn't find it all that challenging save for a few segments. Granted, I did a lot of reloading saved games when I started losing a battle or got a bad dice roll/outcome. On my next playthrough I definitely plan on playing Honour Mode which prevents cheesing with reloading saved games, makes bosses even harder and has perma death if your entire party dies.

28052, "last_played": 1734850061}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Larian really went into depth with each possible action you could have taken in this game, and that to me is breathtaking, and a good wave of fresh air, compared to the release and ruin of our beloved Dragon Age Veilguard (God rest her soul), Starfield, and the Fable series that is supposedly making a comeback, but I haven't heard much on the new game for it, but we all know how much we loved the third one, just another example of big time producers not taking their fanbase seriously, or just putting plain lazy writing into their games.   Larian clearly has a knack for this kind of thing, and I feel they are the new Bioware, in terms of quality, and diversity in their games.  I'm almost tempted to get Divinity Original Sin, because I know I will love it just the same.   I'm yapping quite a bit, but let me get into Baldur's Gate specifically.   They matched the lore, skillsets, classes, spells, creatures, allies, races, in my opinion, as best as they possibly could, but correct me if I'm wrong.  The graphics are beautiful, the physics, the interactions, the dialogue choices and outcomes changing depending on your class and people interacting with you differently according to your race, most of the time.  There are a few who don't really get any special recognition in conversations, but most of them do, and I think that's amazing.  The diversity in how people act in your presence, reminds me of how Skyrim was with different races as well, and that really brought in great nostalgia for me.  From start to finish, it's an intense journey, not only doing quests and sidequests, but doing companion quests as well, and opening new routes to your relationship with that person depending on your choices, but if you don't have the patience to listen and be closer to them, you really don't have to, but then why have them in your party in the first place?  The characters are so great, and in great detail, have a variety of different personalities that draw you in, so you most likely have favorites along the way. Mine were always Shadowheart, Lae'zel, Karlach, and Gale, but Jaheira was also good.   I apologize if my explanations are kind of lack luster, I'm doing my best not to spoil anything.   That's the beauty of this game though, my particular experience i'm explaining, may not be the same as yours, but I'm a sucker for a goody two shoes playthrough, and so my experience is unique to me.\r\n\r\nCons: As many choices and possible outcomes you have control of along the way, the unfortunate part is that, there IS some illusion of choice. Like if you play durge, and Elfira comes to your camp, and you choose to send her off, she unfortunately ends up dying by you anyway, and if you don't meet with Elfira in the grove, it's usually some other Dragonborn girl, who is very sweet, and I don't think you have the choice to send her off, but regardless, she ends up dying in Elfira's place regardless. It kind of messes with my head, that the only way to send Elfira off is to be an absolute douchebag, but again, if you've met Elfira, she dies regardless, even if she leaves the camp.  Another one is the Underdark, when you free Nere, two other gnomes come out, but one of them gets killed in an instant cutscene usually 5 seconds after breaking the rubble.  I've even tried to attack Nere before the event is triggered, and she just disappears, and it frustrates me that it's forced.  Another sort of forced outcome is killing Cazador, and having the choice to either kill the kids and other prisoners with the staff out of mercy, set them free, and let them roam in the sewers and underdark, and one other choice I can't remember, but I think you can control them, but you can never cure them unfortunately, and that breaks my heart, but I try not to judge it too harshly because maybe that's just Canon and I don't know a damn thing about how D&D works, at least not as much as I'd like. I know it's a lot to ask, but to me, having choices means, any and all possible outcomes should be within our control, and unfortunately, as our actions DO have consequences, both good and bad, you're very limited to like 3 or 4 possible outcomes.   You might think that's good, but truly you have choice A, Choice B, Choice C, or Choice D.  and I think maybe we're just not in that realm that every possible choice can be...well..possible. I would think maybe an AI would have to be in place, and it probably wouldn't be advanced enough in this day and age to really fulfill that many different choices.   With that out of the way, my main thing is the companions, good god, they are thirsty, you haven't known them for even a night, and most of them want to throw themselves at you, right out of the get go, and to me, that's out of character, especially for Lae'zel.  I mean, maybe some of them should be available right away, I mean, some people are like that, but the fact all of them are there throwing themselves at you, but if you don't take them, then the choice for a relationship is suddenly cut off in the next 2 acts if you don't take your chances, and that seems a little unfair, cause maybe I want to get to know them a bit more before doing all of that, especially after doing a quest for them, that would seem a more valuable reason to fall for me, rather than just having fought with the enemy a couple of nights, and now they're all suddenly impressed and hot and bothered, ect.  I love all of the companions except Astarion, and many would argue there's no good reason to single him out, but I mean, from a moral standpoint, you realize he puts himself first in every possible situation, especially when it came to be that he was the reason those children were down in Cazador's prison in the first place.  Vampire or not, he was conscious enough to realize how sick and twisted that was, and in my book, that easily disqualifies him from being any bit likeable, especially when you want to save the grove and protect the kids, and he disapproves, like really? Because you had it hard, you would rather these kids lives be in danger and forfeit, because you never personally knew what safety and compassion felt like?  As I love the actor for him, the character is just a heinous little twat, and he's very full of himself, but he's hot, so we can push his past actions aside and really coddle him because he's upset about his own past. Being a vampire may not have been his choice, but whether or not to follow Cazador, was.   When it comes to the life of a child, the easy choice is, put the child first, let them have a life in exchange for your own, give them what you didn't have, that's the only real genuine choice in the matter, nothing else.  You went through it this way, so he apparently wishes the same on them? Please, if he was ugly, you wouldn't give him the same benefit.   Anyway, besides all of that, I have maybe one more thing that could be seen as a spoiler. Yes there is a happy ending, but unfortunately, I think what causes people to say \"bittersweet\" ending, is that, more or less for everyone to be happy, and have a happy life, either you, or one of your companions must be at its expense.  Anyway, this is all I have, I hope this helps you, and thank you for reading", "timestamp_created": 1735007978, "timestamp_updated": 1735007978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183531907": {"recommendationid": "183531907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035009756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1734940549}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't play games so much anymore.

As someone who had no exposure to turn based games, this was a great experience. Combat was lenient enough to brute force through it without using too much brain. Some fights did need some brain power to gain advantage or even out playing field against the ganks. The story was good. Lae'zel had the best character arc imo. She was also the best damage dealer in my party of Karlach, Lae'zel, Shadowheart and Gale (I played as Karlach for some reason). I missed out on some content in act 2 I think. But in subsequent runs, I plan to get that covered and also try some new things. The game has few annoying things imo. But nothing as annoying as the jump getting disrupted by smallest of obstacles and wasting my movement.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to have an open mind about turn based combat, invest in lot of time in quality story and gameplay, this game is a must have. 9.5/10 for me (docked 0.5 points for some annoying bugs and glitches).", "timestamp_created": 1734990493, "timestamp_updated": 1734990493,

I understand that if you didn't play the classic Baldur's Gate games or are semi new to RPG games in general this is a well made and entertaining game, no question about it. But for someone's who has played through every Divinity, Baldur\u2019s Gate and a score of other RPG's, there is actually not much new stuff to see here. It's a re-skinned Divinity, with all the standard RPG features that are systematically and soullessly put into every RPG these days. Grind through a linear world, get some npc followers and grind through their quests, grind through some standard RPG content, dungeons, puzzles etc. in a world that feels like some kind of an entertainment theme park that you must wade through rather than an actual world that you\u2019d be excited to explore. Nothing feels relevant or connected to a larger plot. The most memorable moments we\u2019re memorable because they were funny, such as asking a random creep gouge out my eye. But even these kinds of moments were mostly immersion breaking comical scenes that made no one in the party including the player character react in anyway.\n\nTo this day, the old BG\u2019s stand out from the masses of RPG\u2019s with their amazing item and combat balancing, non-linear world and epic companions who made you laugh with their silly remarks rather than start instantly pestering you with their boring personal drama. In today\u2019s RPG\u2019s all your NPC\u2019s are some drama bloated whiners whose conversation options you have to exhaust and who all want to get into bed with you as fast as possible just cause sex scenes must be entertaining to the player. They are well designed characters sure, but they all follow the same basic unsurprising formula. And in this game they\u2019re all forcefully tossed into your party during the first 15 minutes of game-play, so there\u2019s no sense that anytime some cool new weirdo might wanna ask to join your party.\n\nThere was actually a lot of interesting variety in the old BG\u2019s NPC scene. For example you could recruit some random evil bastards who approach you cause you\u2019re alone and need some temporary muscle. You have your sister with you who you probably wanna keep alive just cause she\u2019s your sister. You could romance the hot elf in your party IF you get her boyfriend killed first. You have actual reasons to like or dislike your companions, which is completely missing from these modern RPG\u2019s. For example when you finally got a wizard to join your party, you begged to go solve her personal problems just because she\u2019s so freaking useful to your party. Oh and there\u2019s an actual plot and a goal in the old BG\u2019s, but what the heck am I doing in BG3 other than going forward with a maggot in my head (which you don\u2019t even feel a need to get rid of because it gives you powers). And I sure don\u2019t care about the gazillion useless magic items that keep cluttering my inventory as I force myself to rummage through every boring nook and cranny that all yield the same generic loot.\n\nAlso... You\u2019ll be going through hundreds of boring slow paced roll animation skill checks in this game. You\u2019ll be spending more time on removing traps from a puzzle than actually trying to solve a puzzle. Every skill check is pointless, can be fairly easily passed with a character that has no relevant skill level, and even if you fail, you can just load game from just before you made the roll. I have to keep forcing myself to come back to this game, which is not a sign of a very engaging game to me.

Dragon Commander, DOS 1 and of course DOS 2 so good! The Lore is confusing but still bloody fun. I purchased this game in ye olden days of Early access and i thought maybe 60 bucks is too much for EA but i trusted the Studio and i was not disappointed EVEN THOUGH so much jank in those early days i knew something magical was happening (pun intended) You had a lot of freedom and then after sinking many hours into ACT 1 mind you. I would put it down and then play it After every new update i always watch the streams. Sven and the Team have a great sense of humor THE SALAMI. Also Sven is a Discworld Fan so another point. Fast forward Game is released i started a new run as Tav a Half-Orc Sorcerer with a past of being poor and street smart. THE AMOUNT OF LOVE that went into this game is amazing and the level of choice you can do and Speak with the Dead. OWLBEAR AND DOGGO don't get me started on the writing its bloody fantastic the people you choose to travel with don't feel like video game peoples but Actual Characters with their own wants and motivations lots of love went into these performances and Astarion's Voice Actor winning the Game of the Year Award is well deserved. \nThis notion that we shouldn't expect games from other major Devs of this love and quality is just where the AAA industry is currently at rn they care more about profit margins, a formula instead of trying something new. Svens speech was always  on spot on and like he said you make games that the Devs love to play people will buy it. Instead of chasing Trends stop being so safe. Also enough with Celebrities in Video Games its distracting (Except Johnny Silverhand and Idris Elba) they are awesome and ofc JK simmons.

While BG and BG2 were turn-based with pause, BG3 is fully turn-based; where BG2 was based on D&D 2e and 3e, BG3 is based on 5e. Since I had no tabletop experience with it before this game, it also served as an introduction to 5e for me (or at least Larian's house-ruled version, as changes are inevitable when you're translating a game from pen and paper to computer). So a lot of this review is actually going to be about that, too.\n\nI was skeptical when I heard that despite its length, the game topped out at 12th level (BG1's low level combat was extremely one-sided, and BG2 [i]starts[/i] at 8-10, depending on class) and that your party had no more than 4 people (down from 6), but as it turns out this is mostly compensated for by the deepened combat system. Mobility and positioning are far more important now, since movement is restricted each turn and enemies make far better use of theirs. Spell-like abilities are far more abundant, meaning pure spellcasters are not as impressive/overpowered as they used to be. Battles are now much more an exercise into correctly applying the limited use of every character's vast pool of options, rather than the classic \"mage and fighter meat shields\" setup of most BG2 battles. Both systems have their pros and cons, but the 5e system is a lot more balanced between classes if nothing else. Though, if you like your fights absolutely unbalanced and unfair, BG3 has plenty of options for that as well, mostly by abusing the physics system in ways I'm sure a tabletop DM would never allow.\n\nSpeaking of classes, that's been completely overhauled too, with the ability to pick a class on every level, rather than the mechanically more complicated and restricted multiclassing and dualclassing from 2e/3e. This is a fun and versatile system that allows you to mix and match proficiencies and abilities to build a character you like without being dependent on having a specific kit designed for them. One thing that holds back the fun somewhat is that the game's length means you will be at the lower levels for a [i]long[/i] time, so if you have a build planned that only really comes into its own at the later levels you'll be waiting on that quite a bit. You do get access to a cheap and easy way to respec your character early in the game, so switching builds depending on their viability at each stage is an option.\n\nIn terms of the actual combat in the game, the biggest hurdle is understanding the system and the action economy (there are \"actions\" and \"bonus actions\" and they are mostly not interchangeable), but once you do most fights pose little problem. There are only a handful of fights I would call challenging, and even on the highest difficulty levels you will find yourself with an inventory full of weapons, items and consumables that you don't need to win. The main thing making the game's hardest difficulty setting \"honour mode\" a true challenge is that you have to do it all on a single save, which enforces extreme caution. I personally prefer just having tougher but replayable battles over an ironman mode, but fortunately the game is very moddable, so there's options if you want the game harder, or trivialize combat entirely so you can focus on the story.\n\nCombat mechanics aside, the role-playing part is where it gets really fun. Whereas the standard approach in most RPGs is fighting, or getting a quest item, or getting a quest item by fighting, BG3 leans a lot more into your character's background and proficiencies, and relies on abundant dice rolls for everything. Skipping things or doing them out of order is practically the norm, and the game is built to handle it. When it's firing on all cylinders, the game feels like an actual tabletop session of D&D, where your party pulls outrageous stunts (and/or spectacular failures) based on how the dice favored their crazy ideas, while the DM wearily looks on and rewrites campaign notes in the background. There is still plenty of combat and a few major places where fighting your way out is unavoidable, but these stand out when contrasted with how often you can talk or physically manipulate your way out of things. As with any CRPG there are still always places where you wished you had more options, but the game does a good job of accommodating you.\n\nSo is the game perfect then? Well, no, nothing is. It's very, very good, but there are blemishes. Small physics, camera and UI glitches that are fortunately mostly resolved by saving and loading the game. A classic if by now a bit antiquated approach to loot where the game showers you with magical items, but most of them are not very interesting or impressive and get chucked on the pile. Some mechanics, while adding flavor, feel tacked-on and inconsequential -- camp supplies, alchemy, dyes. There are cameos from companions in earlier games, but the story doesn't gel very well with how things were left at the end of the Bhaalspawn saga. There are weaknesses around the storyline if you want to play an \"evil\" character, with \"good\" characters definitely getting to see and do more. And while the game's immense size is surely hard to fault in terms of value for money, it does mean that by Act Three, when your course is pretty well set and it seems like things are ramping up to a confrontation, the game still throws new side quests at you like you're just starting out, which can lead to fatigue if you're not able to simply plow ahead and ignore them. \n\nSo with all that, do I recommend BG3? ...are you kidding? If the many other reviews didn't already give you an indication, BG3 is an RPG with phenomenal and probably unparalleled scope, size, depth and quality, and more importantly, the ability to pull you in and keep you hooked. I've spent many a day going to bed far later than I should have just because there was \"one more quest\" to finish up, \"one more area\" to explore, and before I knew it I was neck deep into new shenanigans. It brought me all the way back to a time where BG2 was, for a long time, the only game I played, to the point where I learned all the ins and outs of the engine and even made a few mods for it myself. I'm (probably!) not going to go that far for BG3, but it definitely gave me the same feeling of wanting to go for another playthrough almost immediately after I'd finished the first one, even knowing how many hours that was going to take, just to do things differently this time. That time commitment is definitely not for everyone, as shown by the fact that no less than [i]half[/i] of all players don't even make it through Act One, but this game is so large that even just Act One would qualify as a full price release on its own for most studios. Not so Larian, and while they've broken many hearts by saying there won't be an expansion or sequel to BG3, by the end of this game you definitely feel the weight of all that effort and time the developers sank into it, and you can't really blame them for going \"enough\".\n\n[i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is a game I think everyone should play, even if you don't complete it. Those who like CRPGs will almost certainly love it, those who have never played CRPGs may come to like the genre, and all in all this game is probably the best advertisement for [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] outside of the source material. It's a ray of sunshine in a gaming industry where insidious mediocrity and shameful cash grabs have become the norm for AAA releases, and we should thank our lucky stars for the fact that it's very replayable, because unfortunately we're not likely to see its match any time soon.", "timestamp_created": 1734782181, "timestamp_updated": 1734786302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81984102725982666", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182959652": {"recommendationid": "182959652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061301018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6380, "last_played": 1713032386}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically a game with branching choices.

The good parts make the game worth playing, while the bad parts tend to help me to not get too involved in the game.\n\nThe graphics are decent, but I do find it funny to see and hear the NPCs talking out of sync with the animations of the mouth, facial expressions, and their gestures. \n\nThe game camera can be annoying at times, but that is something that plagues all games of this style, especially in tight spaces.\n\nThe details of the environment and music is where the game excels. This vastly improves the story and gaming experience.\n\nThe stories are the most important part of this game for me. For this reason, I found myself questioning if I would be interested in finishing this game on multiple occasions. I took a long break at one point, for several months, because of how invasive the \"adult\" content was. Every character was pressuring the player to engage with them intimately. Some would even respond with a guilt trip type response when rejected. Gale was thankfully toned down, but seems Haslin is still just as persistent, in which I had to reject him no less than four times before he responded with a statement that he had to at least try. I even told him that I was involved with Shadowheart, he asked for a three-way. I find this very poor writing and awareness by the writers and takes away from the story and engagement of the lore and game. \n\nExcluding the overly forced and non-enjoyable attempts to turn the game into a brothel experience, the story is very intriguing. I like the concept and the game pacing seems to keep the game from feeling like a drag. I always had some quest that was actually compelling, if even not rewarding, due to it adding to the lore and explanation of the situation. \n\nAct I is a bit forced at the start, feeling rushed to get the player engaged, but gets better as it goes. \n\nAct II is the best part of the game and the most enjoyable. Each area has so much to explore and unique scenes that stuck with me. I found myself replaying Act II a few times to try different things, as the choices had some wildly different outcomes. This is the most pivotal part of the game, from what I saw.\n\nAct III is a little hit and miss. This was also where Haslin kept asking me for more than friendship and eventually a three-way with Shadowheart. I did find that relationships have no impact on one another, as I could get the achievements with hooking up with Karlach and Squiddy, and it did not have any negative outcome with essentially cheating on Shadowheart. Comically, Shadowheart was not so interested in the twins at the brothel, which I was good with, as I had no interest either. Whoever wrote this stuff needs to touch grass and get a real relationship. \n\nThe best part of Act III was the introduction to the atmosphere. Past that, it felt systematic and detracted from anything being unique, minus the Bhaal side of things which was very well done. \n\nThe best part of the game is the music and atmosphere, which saved the story on many occasions, when it seemed it was more interested in letting me know what kind of intimate behavior an NPC preferred, over anything of substance for the story. I know the cleric likes the winged woman, and that the winged woman is the dominating partner of that relationship. I know it many times. I know Karlach wants to get freaky, I know it many times. I know Wyll has daddy issues and is repressed intimately, and I know it many times. I know that Gale will sleep with anything that moves, though that was toned down from when I first had to deal with it, thankfully.

This isn't the first time (and it certainly won't be the last) Larian have put out a masterpiece. It's a shame that WOTC is such an unpleasant company to do business with, because the geniuses at Larian Studios have truly brought Faer\u00fbn to life in the most exciting and interesting ways possible.\n\nThe stories BG3 tells throughout its ~100h runtime (for a singular play-through) are excellent and are all worth experiencing, and from its companions to its villains, it's almost comical how easy it is to sympathise and relate to their tales. Their take on the combat system this time around was great, and still manages to feel unique even if you're coming from one of Larian's other games, such as Divinity: Original Sin 2. Speaking of DOS2, I also love the many ways you can approach combat encounters, whether it's talking your way out of it, setting up oil barrels and starting combat with an explosive kick, sneaking all of your party into advantageous positions to surprise the enemy, or just charging head-first into the fight.\n\nAnother improvement Baldur's Gate 3 has over Larian's previous titles is definitely the class system. While I loved DOS2 and the combinations you could pull off (Pyro/Geomancy, Hydro/Aerotheurgy, etc), I found that a lot of the classes were very similar in how they played and the skills they had access to. Here, each of the 12 classes offer different playstyles and absolutely have their own strengths and weaknesses. And yes, while some classes are definitely stronger than others (looking at you Paladin!), you can easily beat the game with any of the 12 and still enjoy it all the same. Multi-classing is also a tool that allows you to get even more complex with your character-building, but do not feel as if you need to utilise it to beat the game. It's definitely something you'll enjoy experimenting with once you've beaten the game once or twice.\n\nIn conclusion, PLEASE buy Baldur's Gate 3. It is easily one of the greatest CRPGs of all time and I am incredibly excited to see Larian's next works (Divinity 3 hopefully?).

My partner bought it shortly after launch, and I went in basically blind. Oh boy, was I in for it.\n\nI'm obsessed and I'm going to tell you exactly what I think.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\n[b]Playtime: ~100 hours.[/b]\nSome do it in 80, others do it in 200. It depends on how much time you want to spend exploring and talking to NPCs; the maps are extensive and chock full of goodies. The layout of the maps does a good job of guiding you towards the vital stuff \u2013 quests, enemies, treasure \u2013 and it\u2019s entirely optional to explore nooks and crannies. I\u2019ll just say that [b]a few locations will give you a warning to \u201ctie up any loose ends\u201d \u2013 heed the warning before charging ahead.[/b]\n\nThe 4 difficulties (Explorer, Balanced, Tactician, and Honour Mode) are great for players of all kinds. I\u2019m not gloating when I say this \u2013 I dipped into Explorer Mode for a Dark Urge run to just zip through as quick as possible, and it really didn\u2019t feel like anything was missing. The game is so rich in almost every aspect that despite the lack of challenge in combat ([i]for me[/i]), I was enthralled. (I got into more fights just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, the game wouldn\u2019t let me singlehandedly dismantle Baldur\u2019s Gate\u2019s police force no matter how hard I tried.) The step up from each difficulty is a pleasant punch to the face, too.\n\nI [i]love[/i] the turn-based combat mechanics. Instead of relying on reflexes and muscle memory, you are required to be economical and strategic. Your turn can be 10 seconds or 10 hours \u2013 which also means I never feel like the game is holding me hostage from answering the phone or jumping up when I hear a cat chewing on plastic. Even with the slower pace, fights are anything but boring; when I\u2019m running out of spells, running out of healing potions, and running out of health, I catch myself holding my breath during the enemies\u2019 turns.\n\nI\u2019ve already been playing D&D for years, so I can\u2019t speak to the learning curve of having no knowledge of D&D. [i](If you are one of those people, browsing class overviews on Wikidot or DnDBeyond can help.)[/i] However, the game did help me understand classes I wasn\u2019t familiar with; I have used BG3 to test drive character builds. Seeing the characters in action gives me a clearer impression of their utility than the sourcebooks do. The implementation of the TTRPG into a single-player video game has been done [i]so well[/i]. There are variations and limitations, of course, but I am still shocked by how much creativity is not only allowed but encouraged. As of writing this, Larian is developing Patch 8, which will implement 12 additional subclasses on top of the 46 existing ones.\n\n[i]Graphics are beautiful[/i]. Admittedly, I\u2019m playing on a fairly new, high-powered PC so I\u2019m having the best experience. There are some animation pops, clipping, and odd camera angles, but they are negligible. Larian continually smooths these out with updates.\n\n[h2]Writing[/h2]\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nThe story is [i]rich[/i]. I\u2019ll be honest, in my first game I was kind of just along for the ride \u2013 which is kind of on the nose for the hero of the story. For someone as unobservant as I am, the main story beats are easy to follow; these are the good guys, these are the bad guys. There are some grey areas, and the course of action is up to the player\u2019s judgement. In those cases, the game seems to be pretty forgiving. I encourage folks to avoid spoilers; the consequences of your actions are evocative. In one game I was giggling and kicking my feet \u2013 in another, I actively hated myself for what I\u2019d done. Okay, I\u2019m being dramatic about the latter, but I did feel like Larian was holding up a mirror asking, \u201cYou wanted evil, right? Is this evil enough? Aren\u2019t you having [i]fun?[/i]\"\n\nAnd there are [b]So Many Choices[/b]. So many paths you can take. Most of them are tiny detours that only give you a unique dialogue line, of course, but some of them will take you in wildly different directions. Your class, your race, your deity (if applicable) \u2013 all open up avenues to explore.\n\n[b][i]I\u2019ve written so much and I\u2019m just talking about playing as your own custom character, there\u2019s even more content if you choose to play as one of the pre-existing characters-[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]Companions[/h1]\nI have adopted them into a polycule in my mind. Jk but not really\nFirst impressions don\u2019t last; I immediately liked half of them, disliked a couple, and was ambivalent about the rest. Act 1 was rough the first time around \u2013 the group felt discordant and all of them were trying to pull my attention in one direction or another. Which is\u2026exactly how it\u2019s supposed to be. You\u2019re 6 strangers vying for your survival in different ways and, like, everyone thinks they know best and no one wants to die. They have very distinct personalities; it is interesting to see there are folks that vehemently detest my fave.\n\nAnd then, with the slightest bit of diplomacy, everyone learns to cooperate. I\u2019ve never actually made a companion hate me enough to leave (via disapproval \u2013 Durge choices need not apply here). The companions\u2019 mannerisms and attitudes do change throughout the course of the game \u2013 and it can vary from one player to the next, depending on the myriad choices you\u2019re presented with. Which is why I have 900 hours under my belt. I am delighted by the intricacies of the characters and I want to see them [i]all[/i].\n\nThe romances are fun! Each of the companions \u2013 save for Jaheira and Minsc \u2013 can be smooched if you win them over. Each romance has its own flavour and vibe. I\u2019ve only seen Gale, Halsin, and Karlach\u2019s romanced endings \u2013 they\u2019re beautiful and heartbreaking and inspiring. Still, not even every romance ends the same way. I know of 4 Gale endings alone \u2013 [i]so far[/i].\n\nI can\u2019t talk about the companions without mentioning that Wyll was definitely hung out to dry. Although you, the player, have ultimate control over the party\u2019s direction, each companion still has a degree of autonomy over their individual arcs that you can influence. Wyll, though, feels like a backseat passenger to his own life \u2013 and his arc is most closely tied to the overarching plot. He doesn\u2019t have enough content, and I\u2019m not hopeful that will change with future patches.\n\n[h2]Atmosphere[/h2]\nSound design is immaculate. I play with headphones and the ambient environmental sounds are immersive in each area, whether you\u2019re in the titular city or a ruined temple. The soundtrack is stellar and I put it on just to vibe to. I do turn the music down to 40%, though, because it can compete with character dialogue on occasion. \n\n[h2]Community[/h2]\nAt large, I believe the community is wonderful. I see many folks lending a helpful hand to one another over social media, sharing their characters and weaving their own stories. Every community has its bad apples, and with how many folks from around the world are in this online sphere, we have our fair share. The positive vibes far outweigh the negative ones.\n\n[h2]Support[/h2]\nLarian has its finger on the pulse when it comes to the BG3 community; it\u2019s obvious they care about the playerbase and strive to give us a good experience. They frequently release fixes and communicate their plans to offer support. I\u2019ve had to reach out to their team twice and received responses in a timely manner. This isn\u2019t to suggest they are perfect and infallible, but it is the first experience I\u2019ve had where I feel like I have a collaborative rapport with a developer \u2013 which goes a long way in my books.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

This game has completely redefined my perception of what a \u2018game\u2019 can be. Never before has a game impacted me to such extent and immersed into an unforgettable experience.\n\nHaving no prior knowledge with the Baldur\u2019s Gate series or the concept of DnD, I approached this game as a newbie. At the time, I had only recently discovered DnD itself. When Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 was recommended to me, claiming it was \u201cbetter than actual DnD,\u201d I was nothing but intrigued. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying BG3 even more than any of my DnD sessions.\n\nCharacter Creation: An absolute beauty\n\nThe journey begins with a very satisfying character creation systems I\u2019ve ever encountered. Whether crafting the most handsome character imaginable or a grotesque monstrosity, the choice is entirely yours. As a perfectionist and Sims player my whole life, I spent my first hour fine-tuning every detail to ensure the character I was about to embark on a long journey with was up to my standard.\n\nI could explain in absolute detail how in love I am with a character creation but there is other aspects of the game that also need to be mentioned here.\n\nStunning Voice Acting and World-building\n\nFrom the outset, BG3 captivated me with its phenomenal voice acting and a cast of distinctive, memorable characters. The open world is breathtaking, and travelling from place to place felt engaging thanks to the dynamic interactions between companions. (''A lover, perhaps'' waiting on Astarion in Baldur's Gate might be Tav after all dangers settle?) These moments made the world feel alive, as though events continued beyond my character\u2019s actions.\n\nThe variety of companions available early in the game was overwhelming\u2014in the best way. Choosing who is put in a camp time out and who get's to honourably go down to 1HP with yourself, truly magnificent. There were characters I would rather not be stuck with for the rest of the game so I was glad to find out that the choice is entirely ours.\n\nA Rich Narrative\n\nInitially, I was worried that the game\u2019s 3 acts might feel too short. Completely false! In my first play-through, I rushed through the story, missing much of the content. By the time I reached Act 3, my under-levelled characters struggled, I struggled, the world struggled. It has prompted me to start over with a new save. This time, I embraced exploration and discovered just how much I had overlooked originally. Side quests, characters, combats etc. I have also finally got an explanation as to why some \u201cbone man\u201d had appeared in my camp out of the blue.\n\nOn my second play-through, I have decided to go against my dream visitor in Act 2 (minor spoiler: he says ''Stay away from a Githyanki). I faced Lae'zel awkwardly at that point. Because I ignored him this time, I have managed to get my pretty Tav hands on the Creche's treasure and well, get an absolute telling off from Astarion. Yes I know you were RIGHT THERE!\n\nEndless Replayability\n\nA single save can easily take over 100 hours to complete, especially with thorough exploration. Yet, even after finishing the game, I found myself longing for the character creation screen again and again. Imagining new play styles and story lines. The possibility of playing an evil character\u2014perhaps a rogue striving for world domination while allied with Astarion only and the game ends with a happy ending (for me, obviously) as they kiss in the ash and bones of the fallen ones around them. The endless potential makes BG3 an unparalleled experience.\n\nA Masterpiece of Game Design\n\nBG3 pushes the boundaries of gaming in every aspect. Larian Studios has crafted a world that feels alive, with an astonishing level of detail in graphics, dialogue, and storytelling. The voice acting is exceptional; every actor delivers a performance that brings their character to life, whether lovable or loathsome. \n\nThe soundtrack deserves a special mention, too. From the haunting beauty of the opening theme where ''Down by the River'' makes an uninvited appearance in my brain like the dream visitor (I tend to sing it at least once a week in my head, that song has made an imprint in my memory core) to the beautiful shifts in music during exploration and combat, it\u2019s an auditory masterpiece.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a groundbreaking achievement that has set a new standard for RPGs. Larian Studios on a fine evening, rolled a D20 with critical success and created what we know now as Baldur's Gate 3. The studio deserves all the credit for creating such game. It\u2019s no surprise this title has been awarded for Game of the Year. \n\nThe full price I paid felt fully justified, and the continuous updates from Larian are a delightful bonus.\n\nFor now, I\u2019m off to create yet another character and finally embark on a durge play-through.

The first thing i noticed before even getting into the game was the soundtrack, BG3 has the best soundtrack my ears have ever heard in a video game in my 20 years of playing up there with 007 Golden Eye (IYKYK). It really sets the tone during gameplay as well as when you are customizing your character lets your imagination just flow hearing the soft fantasy folk like music while creating something you see fit to want in your play-through.\n\n2. This game really pushed the boundaries and showed AAA Developers that when their is love and passion dumped into a game the people will notice. Larian Studios and the voice actors of this game are what this industry needs more of. Transparency, Love, Passion and Dedication was all seen in the making and developing of this game unlike other AAA Developers we have seen in the past as well as now, I'm talking about you Ubisoft, Activision, Blizzard, etc. \n\n3. If you are not a Dungeons and Dragons fan and have never played the table top before this is a perfect way to get 3 of your friends to go through a pre made story not needing a DM and enjoying the journey ahead. If you dont have 3 friends you can still play single player and or play with 1 or 2 friends and still enjoy the game just as much if youi had a full party.\n\n4. Larin Studios listening to the community and adding a Mod Manager was next level for any player who has played multiple runs as well as adding new dialogue for companions like Minthara etc. in The character customization is good but with mods is really flushed out and adds a ton of options compared to base game options. Race/Class/Subclass are all interchangeable.\n\n5. The gameplay and graphics are amazing, I have a Intel core I7 12th gen with 32 GB of RAM and a 3060 Graph Card and run the game on High graphics with 60 fps steady. The only gripe i have on this game is the level cap is too low base game and i think they should have made it a lvl 20 cap instead of 12 but with mods being a thing that is in the past for me since I can change that on the fly thanks to Larian Studios adding a Mod Manager in the game not only for PC but for console and MAC users as well which is such a next level step its crazy to see how far they are going to please their fans and i can not wait to see what they do with their own stand alone IP.\n\nAll in all this game to me is one of the best games to have been released in the last 20-30 years and will be cemented as an example to other Studios on what should be the standard across the board in the industry.", "timestamp_created": 1734826075, "timestamp_updated": 1734826075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183299028": {"recommendationid": "183299028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989247879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3827, "playtime_at_review": 17441, "last_played": 1734996690}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good it totally makes you forget the time and allows to to come up with the most silly ideas it doesnt give you clear steps it just gives you information which you sometimes have to find this game makes you work things out.
