"review": "[h1]Grand Theft Auto V: The Game That Steals Your Free Time (And Maybe Your Sanity)[/h1]\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about GTA V, the game that\u2019s been around since the dinosaurs\u2014or at least three console generations. Whether you\u2019re a fan of heists, flying cars, or just punching random pedestrians for no reason, Grand Theft Auto V has something for everyone. It\u2019s chaotic, absurd, and a little too good at sucking you into its madness.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Story Mode: 9/10[/u][/b]\r\nYou\u2019ve got three protagonists: Michael, the middle-aged guy having a mid-life crisis; Franklin, the guy trying to escape the hood; and Trevor, who is\u2026 well, Trevor. Their stories collide in a whirlwind of crime, betrayal, and explosive chaos. It\u2019s like a soap opera with rocket launchers.\r\n\r\nThe missions are a rollercoaster of insanity. One minute you\u2019re doing a simple repo job, the next you\u2019re flying a helicopter while Trevor yells about something that probably isn\u2019t legal. The story is gripping, hilarious, and just the right amount of ridiculous.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Graphics: 10/10 (Except When You Mod It Too Much)[/u][/b]\r\nVisually, GTA V still holds up. Los Santos is a sprawling, vibrant playground where you can admire the sunset\u2014or crash a stolen jet into it. But let\u2019s be real: most of us modded the game to oblivion, replacing cars with UFOs and turning every NPC into Shrek. At that point, it\u2019s less \"graphics\" and more \"personal fever dream.\"\r\n\r\n[b][u]Gameplay: 10/10 (Infinite Chaos Edition)[/u][/b]\r\nWhat can\u2019t you do in GTA V? Rob a bank? Check. Fly a jet? Double check. Spend an hour driving like a law-abiding citizen only to lose it and plow into a hot dog stand? Triple check.\r\n\r\nThe sheer variety of activities ensures you\u2019ll never get bored. And if you do, there\u2019s always GTA Online\u2014which is basically a giant sandbox of chaos, microtransactions, and griefers who only exist to blow up your personal car.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Soundtrack: 9/10[/u][/b]\r\nThe radio stations are back, and they\u2019re as iconic as ever. Whether you\u2019re jamming to West Coast classics on Radio Los Santos or headbanging to some rock on Vinewood Boulevard Radio, the music makes every moment better. Even that time you accidentally drove into the ocean.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Online Mode: 7/10 (Depending on Your Blood Pressure)[/u][/b]\r\nGTA Online is a chaotic masterpiece. You can do heists, run businesses, buy a yacht you\u2019ll never use, or just get blown up by some 12-year-old who saved all their allowance for a flying motorcycle. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s frustrating, and it\u2019s a constant reminder that capitalism is alive and well\u2014even in Los Santos.\r\n\r\nPro tip: If you ever feel rich, visit the in-game store. Nothing humbles you faster than realizing you can\u2019t afford that fancy penthouse without selling your virtual soul to Shark Cards.\r\n\r\n[h1]GTA Roleplay: When Fun Turns Into a Heist (Against You)[/h1]\r\n\r\nAh, GTA RP, where people take Los Santos way too seriously. I joined a community, built a character, made friends, and thought, \u201cWow, this is great!\u201d And then one of the leaders pulled the ultimate heist: stealing our money. Not in-game. Real money.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Gameplay: 8/10 (Until Someone Robs You IRL)[/u][/b]\r\nRoleplay is immersive, hilarious, and occasionally ridiculous. You\u2019ll play a cop, a criminal, or that weird guy running a taco stand who somehow knows everyone\u2019s secrets. It\u2019s great\u2014until you realize the real criminals are running the server.\r\n\r\nImagine grinding hours in-game, donating to support the community, and then waking up to find out the \u201cleader\u201d has vanished with everyone\u2019s cash. It\u2019s like a heist movie, except you\u2019re the victim and there\u2019s no satisfying third act.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Community: 4/10 (Trust Issues Edition)[/u][/b]\r\nRP communities are hit or miss. When it\u2019s good, it\u2019s amazing\u2014people genuinely commit to their roles, and the stories are unforgettable. When it\u2019s bad, well\u2026 let\u2019s just say I learned the hard way that not everyone playing a shady character in-game is acting.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Final Verdict for RP: 6/10[/u][/b]\r\nGTA RP is a blast if you find the right community. Just do your homework before you start trusting anyone with more power than you. And remember, in the world of RP, the line between \"roleplay villain\" and \"real-life scammer\" is thinner than a Shark Card balance.\r\n\r\n[h1]Final Thoughts: GTA V and RP Combined[/h1]\r\nWhether you\u2019re living out your chaotic fantasies in GTA V or diving into the unpredictable world of RP, this game gives you memories\u2014some hilarious, some painful, all unforgettable. Just remember, Los Santos is a dangerous place, both in-game and out.\r\n\r\nFinal verdict for both: 9/10 for the laughs, 1/10 for the trust issues.", "timestamp_created": 1735037333, "timestamp_updated": 1735037333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183555055": {"recommendationid": "183555055", "author": {"steamid": "76561199380114561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 922, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1735057170}, "language": "english", "review": "should rename this to: driving simulator with guns and drugs", "timestamp_created": 1735036118, "timestamp_updated": 1735036118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183554855": {"recommendationid": "183554855", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970573473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1735035436}, "language": "english", "review": "Not only does this require a 3rd party launcher but also requires you to install BattleEye to play the single player game.

knowing what to do. when i figured out how to shoot people, i took full advantage of that and shot everyone i saw. naturally, the police came, and i wasnt very good at games at the time since i was young, so i ran. they chased me all the way to the pier, and i tried to swim away but eventually died. even though i didnt know what to do, what the game was about, and had never played a game of the sort at the time, it was 100% the most fun id had on any other game. years later, id buy it on my xbox, and get days, probably weeks of gameplay time on there. shortly after my xbox had passed, id bought it on my pc, wanting to relive all of the experiences id had on my xbox. i dont have many hours on steam, but i have so many hours overall i wouldnt even begin to know how to calculate them. this is definitely my longest and most in depth review, so i think that tells people its worth the money, even though im sure everyones plently aware of that.", "timestamp_created": 1735031221,

I feel like all they did was add a bunch of new vehicles, weapons, and clothes while completely neglecting the actual game. \n\nHonestly I hope GTA 6 will add more things to do, because literally I gave up on GTA 5 online back in 2016 because of how bland it was after you got everything. That was back on console, and I see how much this game \"progressed\" and all they did was add more vehicles, weapons, and clothes. Ffs Rockstar.\n\nYou can only drive around and cause chaos in the GTA5 map until you get bored with the base vanilla game and start modding the crap out of it. I swear the mods are the only reason I play GTA5, when in reality it should be Rockstar providing new things for people to look forward to.\n\nThey literally think \"Oh, let's add a new heist, a new set of vehicles! Oh! Let's add another business for players to grind in!\" I swear the only update I've seen where they actually added stuff for you to do in the map was the Casino, and literally all you do there is gamble or spin a wheel to get something. \n\nIt's as if Rockstar doesn't know what the players want, so they just continuously milk the players of their wallets or force them to grind to be \"invested\" in the online GTA5. Meanwhile people are trying to find something fun to do, so they literally just do online competitions such as PVP, races, and etc. Or do the usual and kill other players around the map.\n\nAnd guess what you get for all of it? More fictional money to continue the cycle of killing other players in the map or cause chaos with.\n\nAs I said, I hope GTA6 changes, because if they release a more polished GTA5 with no new things to do in it, I'll lose my mind with Rockstar. For over a decade of GTA5 being out, I've wanted to be able to have more stores to rob in the overworld, the ability to actually rob civilians to pawn the items I stole off of them, or stealing cars to go sell to some blackmarket place. \n\nYou get the point, I don't need to list ALL of the things me and other players want out of GTA. Aka, GRAND THEFT AUTO.\n\nHeists are fine, but once they are released for players to participate in, they get stale and boring. Just like the GTA 5 storymode missions. \n\nGTA should be about what you can do in the environment surrounding you, not go from point A to point B like it's some Call of Duty mission. You know GTA5 is boring when all you can do in the actually map is Missions, activities, kill people and steal their cars, be a straight up terrorist, and side missions.\n\nLike, doing the whole chaos thing is fun, until you realize that's literally all you can do. I can go cause chaos in games like Postal 2 or hell even that one edgy game Hatred. But when I boot up GTA I expect there to be some chaos and violence, yes, but there should be CRIMINAL activities that you can do around the map. \n\nHow can anyone be invested in this game when you don't feel like a criminal in a game that's supposed to be about being a criminal? Without mods to add more things to do in the game, it gets boring fast. Like what are all the 110 GBs this game adds to your computer for? The NPCs walking around that you can slaughter? If so, this isn't GTA, it's more like Postal 2 with better graphics and you can drive cars.\n\nI know the excuse for there not being much in the map to do is because of \"PS3/XBOX360 limitations\", but this game has been out for 11 years now as of writing this. And it's pretty obvious Rockstar still releases \"updates\" for this game because they continuously add unnecessary missions, vehicles, and items. There really is no excuse for that.\n\nIt's like if I built one sand castle on a beach with a plastic shovel and said \"I can't do anything else with this\" and proceed to decorate the hell out of that one sand castle without even bothering to add more buildings or other sand castles. \n\nNothing changes besides the one sand castle, and eventually you get bored with it and leave and all you got is that one sand castle. That's pretty much Rockstar with GTA5 in a nutshell.\n\nAs I've said, I'll continue playing the modded GTA5, but I refuse to play the vanilla/online GTA 5. It's just that boring and disappointing to even waste my time with. And who knows what GTA6 will have to offer, but I have a feeling they may just do the same to that as they've done with GTA5, which is of course milk it and neglect it.\n\nI hope they aren't planning to do that, but we'll just have to see. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735010273, "timestamp_updated": 1735010273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183533986": {"recommendationid": "183533986", "author": {"steamid": "76561199402593678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 7417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4201, "playtime_at_review": 7417, "last_played": 1734917400}, "language": "english", "review": "gta", "timestamp_created": 1735010269, "timestamp_updated": 1735010269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183533811": {"recommendationid": "183533811", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121969850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3384, "playtime_at_review": 19593, "last_played": 1735020765}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1735010082, "timestamp_updated": 1735010082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183533641": {"recommendationid": "183533641", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194900234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1461, "last_played": 1691975260}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good classic game.

But with Rockstar's recent decision to put in a new anti-cheat that prohibits me from playing the game simply because I don't use Windows I can no longer recommend playing this game.\n\nI used to play this game almost religiously by myself or with my friends but now all I can do is play the single player. The single-player story is good don't get me wrong, but you can only replay it so many times. I would play FiveM servers if I could but guess what? Those also don't work with Linux users. overall I'm just unable to play the game mode I enjoy the most in this game.\n\nAs an act of protest even though I know it may not do much, Is first post this review and second not even bothering with this game anymore. nor any Rockstar game, even GTA Vl when it comes out. The constant jabs I see multiple companies take against people who use Linux are deeply concerning and upsetting. however, I am willing to come back to Rockstar if they would simply just allow people like me to play the game.\n\nTo sum everything up I'll say this. \"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.\" -TheReportOfTheWeek / Reviewbrah", "timestamp_created": 1734170190, "timestamp_updated": 1734172078, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823027193546295166", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182825675": {"recommendationid": "182825675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353333653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 10122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10122, "deck_playtime_at_review": 6139, "last_played": 1726871819}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The controls are impenetrable and seem to change in every context imaginable. Taking cover seems to have a 50/50 chance of not helping. The game has a bad habit of not explaining a context control I've been given until the last second. Driving is obnoxious because the AI always tries to crash into you, and is sometimes doggid to that end. There's a lot of things that could be menu driven but aren't, and what is menu driven is so poorly designed that I usually save time googling for what I'm looking for rather than finding it myself.\n\nThe single player's fine, whatever. Game has a nasty habit of putting me in slow, clunky vehicles and then expecting me to outrun the cops. I had a box truck explode on me once after escaping into the hills. Story is average. The characters suck: they're universally either whiny or irrational. Everyone, Trevor included, comes across as weak and passive because they usually just agree to do things for random strangers, friends, and each other without much argument, context, or promise of benefit. At one point I had a day-long internet outage at my home and I couldn't do some of the single player content because it required an internet connection.\n\nThe online world is a deluge of icons and options with barely any direction, so I have no idea what missions would be suitable to my inexperienced butt. There's a good chance that any content I try to interact with in the overworld will either drag me into a situation where I can't adequately defend myself without telling me first or just not work. My friends dragged me into the Cayo Perico heist so I could accumulate enough money to get a reliable income and, no joke, it was an hour of me just dying at the first second of combat and just watching my friends try and fail while IRL tapping on my phone in boredom. I'm pretty sure I could have gotten the same amount of money spending all that time playing the Fleca job over and over again. For Christmas, Rockstar made it so the entirety of Los Santos is covered in snow. OK, so first of all way to break the immersion of living in the sunny deserts of SoCal. Second, the snowfall produces constant rainy weather conditions so traction and turbulence are supremely awful. Third, the game's challenges don't factor the snow in. I gave up entirely after trying and failing for an hour at one of the flight school missions simply because the constant turbulence meant I had 0 input into my plane's movements and would reliably crash.

The people from this studio clearly have no idea how to fix things and they've built the game to discriminate against you if you don't have a friend to play with. After you work really hard to build an inventory to sell and make money in-game from, the game forces you to deliver it all with less time than it takes to actually make a delivery. For example, to deliver $800k in weapons, the game forced me to deliver two trailers across a 30 minute map in only 20 minutes before the game burned $400k of my hard earned funds.\n\nI just finished an air source mission where you were expected to bomb a tug boat and somehow not get shot up in the process by the 20 people down below. My plane was shot down, I exausted my healing and anti-helicopter equipment because of random air attacks that came at me while I was swimming for my life. I finished this 20 minute mission with barely 2 minutes left. Rockstar's idea of Christmas is apparently to blind you at night with snow so you'll fly into the water. After swimming for 10 minutes, I made it to a mountain blocked shore where the sand and rocks were glitched with my character tip-toeing to safety because of bad game design making my feet glitch through the ground OF ROCKS.\n\nAt my nightclub I built a stock of $100k in inventory to sell and when starting the mission, I progressed to the point of picking up a cargobob helicopter to lift the van carrying the lot. Immediately after a tedious 30 seconds of the heli hook picking up the van (somehow, despite physics), white holding down both the right trigger and the left wheel up (forward and up) both cargobob and van flew straight into the ocean, FAILING the mission and burning the money I waited for 6 hours in real life to build up.\n\nNone of this is to mention how Rockstar virtually tells you nothing about what you're supposed to do in various situations. When you start an excess weapons supply mission from your bunker, there are a group of 6 enemy vehicles that come at you in pairs. I had to discover by trial and error that this wasn't infinite. Up to this point, I was being thrown off the road and killed numerous times trying to avoid what I was left to assume was an infinite threat. 0 WARNING FROM ROCKSTAR.\n\nThe game is a masterpiece visually and with the audio, but the mechanics are just terrible.
