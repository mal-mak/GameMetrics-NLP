The game immerses you in the grim darkness of the 40k universe, with a compelling narrative that captures the brutal and heroic tone of the Space Marines. The voice acting and character moments add depth and tension, making it hard to put down.\n\nVisually, the game is a feast for the eyes. The environments are richly detailed, capturing the gothic, industrial aesthetic of the 40k universe perfectly. The sheer scale of battles, combined with the stunning graphics, makes you feel like a true warrior in humanity\u2019s darkest hours.\n\nThe only thing keeping this from a perfect 10/10 is some minor repetition in enemy encounters, but honestly, the gameplay is so fun you won\u2019t care much.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Warhammer or just love action-packed third-person shooters with incredible storytelling and graphics, this is a must-play.

First off it runs really badly but wait its high graphics so thats okay...  no I mean on any setting. Its coded poorly and feels sluggish and clunky and every single thing you do has some unnecessary loading bar. \n\nTurn the game on loading bar \nPick mode loading bar \nUse the menu loading bar\nLoad the level loading bar\nSection loading bar\nCut scene loading\nLeave the game loading bar\nLeave the group loading bar\n\nWhat the fk is the code doing seriously I've played so many similar games and its nothing like this.\n\nThe game overall has a good concept but its designed through the lens of a boomer that played Halo 1 back in the day and so much of this game is copied poorly from Halo 1. The concepts of low ammo like Halo 1 do not work here at all they make the game so annoying and feel like you cant play the god damn game you payed for.\n\nYes there are ammo refills on lower diff but the entire point of the game is to go up difficulty to unlock the better cooler weapons ala its fundamental to the enjoyment of the game to go up. I dont mind hard but the no ammo thing all the time is a terrible experience in a game to which you are more of a fat slow plodding machine. You will spend so much time fat rolling away after your ammo ran out praying your team mate has something left to give to get you to the next zone. AWFUL!\n\nMelee is super overpowered for the simple fact that you dont need to reload and yes you may see people online blasting some creature with a powerful gun but they dont show you the hell that guy went through to get to that max level which hardly anybody has done. The balance overall is totally awful you must play certain combos at higher tiers of difficulty or its just GG because not only is the game balanced in an unfun way the enemies on higher diff are buffed in the stupidest ways. I guarantee you only 000.1% of people have 100% the classes and all weapons in this game it takes forever and is a exercise in insanity to get there.\n\nStat higher is not good difficulty design period and we know this and have known this for a long time. This game on higher difficulty is utterly unfun and boring turning the enemies into annoying bullet sponges which again just makes the no ammo thing unfun. It doesnt matter how clever or creative you are with your skill if you have no ammo you CANT DO ANYTHING !?!? Its awful game design. \n\nIn the table top game yes 3 marines would not take out an entire hive army so giving them infinite ammo would have been an easy way to have a balanced trade off. Theres so many things that could have done instead like lets say make it important I hit my shots with my aim and positioning rather than just wow I exploited what little ammo I have in a cringe cheese fest. Its stupid because the majority of Space Marine armies about all about blasting xenos with GUNS not a bunch of melee stuff thats supposed to be mostly for rare special characters or specialist groups. \n\nSPACE MARINES most iconic main role is to stand in a line and fire bolters with massive bullets into aliens. Nothing in this game rewards or promotes that. It plays like a cringe QTE fighting game in which your action figure has to keep constantly getting close to the alien to perform an animation dance. Getting near Tyranids its supposed to be the most STUPID thing you could ever do their entire race is designed to swarm a target and hack it to death. The idea that this game promotes that space marines are great at running in and swinging a sword is mega stupid. Marines fighting up close is mostly a last resort or for these super hero like figures like Calgar. Overall do not punish people for using a gun as a space marine I cant believe I have to say this...\n\nIf it was up to me I would remove all melee weapons from all the classes but 1 so that the vast majority of players will be relying on a gun like Space Marines all do. Also where is the famous space marine flame thrower and fix the plasma and melta guns they do not operate anything like that in 40k lore. A melta gun is a deadly hot beam the punches holes through tanks its not a shotgun ?!?! All this frustration makes the annoyin clunky progression system feel like a bad job and once youve tryed everything once its hard to wanna replay anything without your friends bolstering the entertainment which they could do in any game.\n\nThe campaign is decent enough but I wouldnt replay it and I found once it switches to chaos enemies it became super annoying and unfun compared to the enjoyable feel of fighting Zerging aliens. Though I will say alot of the special enemies are mega annoying unfun to play against like the lictor or the flying shielded things. Just like in overwatch no one likes shooting sheilds all day. The game really needed more ways to CC enemies but again I guess they want you to use the boring chainsword. So many of the Tyranid shooters are super annoying and cheese and would spawn in ways that make all the fights unfun. The coposition of the mobs is just horrible way too many bullet sponge elites that you can barely dodge all at once and then with this guys shooting you and dropping AOE poison all over the floor its just not fun. \n\nAgain the guns feel awful when they should feel powerful, a space marine bolter is akin to a rapid fire rocket launcher in reality, therefore no biological creature should be able to run through your bullets unhindered by its firepower. The game has this spongey lack of feedback feel thats just not good. When I fire a bolter accurately at a biological creature its head should be ripped clean off and there should be huge holes in any creature I fire at unless its armoured. So many times it feels like unless your using a special your guns do nothing. Which is not Space Marine and not 40k.\n\nOverall dont get me wrong I love 40k and have for a long time but this just isnt right and for a game that relies on repeating content over and over I cant see me let alone a person outside of the 40k fandom to ever keep this game in their regular rotation. This game needed to be more like HellDivers 2 and less like Halo and my hope for improvement is pretty low as again as mentioned the core of the game seems to be running on a very poorly coded platform that is slow with trash netcode that does not facilitate the great multiplayer game this could have grown into.\n\nFor me this game is disappointing in many obvious ways but what has been made clear to me is that 40k becoming a main stream multiplayer game is very much possible and needs to happen. Lets learn from this game and make that happen in future with a more serious long term approach because what we have here is not built to last whether its made good money or not.\n\nFor the Imperium Eternally.\n\nPS. how can you have all these great units in the game like the dreadnaught carnifex and there is no mode/way to play as them literally money down the drain...? It could have been as simple as getting in a tank like in Halo 1 ... fire this design team please god.\n\nAlso I must mention Tyranid blood is not red I can see how they got confused here given they are often covered in red blood that blood is human blood of the victims the ate.\n\nMAKE BOLTERS GREAT AGAIN\n\n \n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1734814214, "timestamp_updated": 1734814214, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544348955154418945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183035289": {"recommendationid": "183035289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041722312", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 4750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4750, "last_played": 1731193579}, "language": "english", "review": "Space marine 2 is an amazing game.

This interactive battle-tome delivers a visceral and glorious recounting of the Space Marines' sacred duty. Allow me to relay my findings.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment I donned the ceramite armor of Captain Titus, the sensation was nothing short of righteous. The thunderous bolter fire, the satisfying weight of the chainsword cleaving through xenos flesh\u2014every engagement brims with fury and honor. The sounds of battle echo as if whispered by the God-Emperor Himself: the roar of engines, the crunch of Tyranids underfoot, and the ever-present war cries of \"FOR THE EMPEROR!\"\r\n\r\nVisually, the battlefield is a masterwork. Each shattered hive city, every blood-soaked ruin, is rendered with such fidelity that one could almost feel the ash of destroyed worlds upon their tongue. The scale of the combat is immense, the Tyranid swarms a seemingly endless tide of claws and chitin, testing the mettle of even the most faithful Astartes. And yet, through grit and sheer determination, I prevailed\u2014a testament to the unbreakable will of the Adeptus Astartes.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer modes offer the camaraderie of fellow battle-brothers and the thrill of coordinated assaults against the Great Devourer. Teamwork is not only encouraged\u2014it is essential.

The tone, breadth, and feel just shows that the people behind this game live and breathe the IP as much as the fans.\n\n [*]+ Visual spectacle that captures the scale and scope of the IP very well. Striking blues of Ultramarines against the blood and gore of Tyranids, against the gothic backdrop of its settings scream quality all throughout, all delivered at a solid clip even at the worst of [i]chaotic[/i] forays on screen.\n\n [*]+ Well-delivered VA work alongside solid writing adds another layer of quality on top of what is already on show. The story is straight up 40k, and directly follows the events following the original Space Marine, culminating in a solid 10-15ish hour experience.\n\n [*]+ That is just the beginning however. Many points in the campaign directly reference a second or even third team involved, [i]and you can play as that team in co-op[/i]! This alone extends what's on offer to well past that initial figure. Oh, and the same solid PvP multiplayer on offer is also not bad.\n\n [*]+ At time of this review, they have just released a new patch that added even more to the game's multiplayer offerings, which bodes well to after-release support moving forward.\n[/list]\n\n======\n\n[list]\n [*]- Whilst the game itself is a magnum opus of a 40K rendition, it is odd that certain elements that were in the first game did not survive the transition to a new dev studio (unlike what is depicted in the game \"crossing the Rubicon\"). Its the small things such as the sound of bolter fire seemingly less.. bombastic than before. Melee impacts outside of really big weapons feel only functional, and not impactful, denying the true strength of these space marines and what they fight against. Game's audio balancing seems a bit lacking in the lower bass regions too.\n\n [*]- The difficulty in understanding Mechanicus Tech-Priests' dialogue, whilst accurate, can be unnecessarily grating on one's ears, requiring subtitle use just to make sense of what is said. Whilst it is accurate to lore, it is a bit too much. Similar situations can be found around the game's campaign as well with other bits of dialogue, seemingly more fitting to require subtitles just to understand what is spoken with some clearer contexts involved.\n\n[*]- By the numbers, and no further. The noticeable \"safe\" development and execution, whilst excellent, is a criminal disservice to the IP. Then again, the argument that trying to push beyond what is safe may end up flopping and thus ruining the game for it... This is why we are not burdened with the job of an Inquisitor of the Holy Inquisition. We cannot fully judge the taint of heresy, from what is truly Emperor-touched unlike they can. (Hell they sometimes can't even do that in the first place...)\n\n [*]- The Eternal War (PvP multiplayer) feature is sadly not an evolution of the original Space Marine 1's multiplayer, but a remake. It does not reach the heights that both the campaign or the coop missions make to, and only feels solid, and no further.\n\n [*]- Upon start of the game, it scans for the Epic Launcher files in an apparent attempt to see crossplay support. On a Steam release. This is not a good look.\n\n [*]- Paid cosmetics DLC's seem rather pricey for what you end up getting.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1734786144, "timestamp_updated": 1734870661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183138302": {"recommendationid": "183138302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070193886", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 688, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1734589305}, "language": "english", "review": "Short campaign like the first but more action packed with a decent amount of other PVE/PVP sections you can play with your friends.", "timestamp_created": 1734639084, "timestamp_updated": 1734639084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527483105659484863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183318158": {"recommendationid": "183318158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078375000", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 1206, "last_played": 1734754896}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this with two friends from beginning to end.

He is serving in Deathwatch, a group of space marines who were accused of heresy (f*** you, Leandros). Its sort of like penal labor. He served there for about a hundred years. Based on his activity during this time, and almost sacrificing himself in a battle, he was reinstated as an Ultramarine.\nHe is then assigned as the leader of a group of ultramarines. Everyone respected him, except for Gadriel (and the Chaplin, who\u2019s Leandros), until he did. Long story short, another Leandros shenanigan was in motion, but Gadriel is a bro, so it didn\u2019t. Other than that, the whole story is about the group proving their worth, Titus proving his loyalty, and Ultramarines showing how bada** they are. The best part is how each character development occurred through the course with no cheesy dialogue/monologue.\n9/10\n________________________________________\nGameplay\nShoot, slash, smash, impale. These are the basic attacks. Its crucial to make as many headshots as possible, because bodyshots take forever to kill. When out of ammo, or facing minoris level enemies, melee attacks are optimal. Try to use combo, especially the one that stomps on the ground/enemy\u2019s face to shock/slow them down for a while to give you some time and space to shoot/melee attack with the intent to kill. Apart from that, there are dodge rolls/jumps, parry, and execution (which is sick af, although some players find it annoying as it slows down the pace, or breaks the combat flow). The balancing was done nicely, but it also made most of the weapons weak af. \nFinding the best weapon is up to you. Finding the best class is also up to you. But when you find the perfect build for you in PvE, it will most likely be mediocre at best in PvP.\n8/10\n________________________________________\nVisuals\nIn a very short moment, you\u2019ll realize the high the stakes are. The scale of the battle is huge. Every single element of the world design seems perfect, including character movements, facial expressions, different animations, even ragdolling and cloth movement animation. The NPC behavior is accurate. The scale of the battle is epic. The visuals are amazing.\n10/10\n________________________________________\nAudio and Music\nNice. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\n10/10\n________________________________________\nTechnical Performance\nAlmost no bugs. The game feels optimized. However, loading time felt a bit longer, although that\u2019s probably because of my ancient system. But one thing that has been an issue for me is the sudden disconnection, and I\u2019m pretty sure that my net connection is more than ok.\n8/10\n________________________________________\nCommunity\nMost supportive in my experience.\n9/10\n________________________________________\nPrice\nReasonable.\n8/10\n________________________________________\nOverall\nFor The Emperor/10", "timestamp_created": 1734715024, "timestamp_updated": 1734847896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183142795": {"recommendationid": "183142795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011054046", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 580, "playtime_at_review": 1217, "last_played": 1734998529}, "language": "english", "review": "Very beautiful game, gives fantastic vibes, it' just a joy to pass time in it and you feel it loves you back.

Space Marine 2 feels like a classic Xbox 360 title in all the best ways. Its story is interesting and keeps you engaged but its not trying to say anything profound. Fact of the matter is you're here to slaughter some Xenos in the thousands and defend humanity for the Emperor. \n\nThe game play is where Space Marine 2 really shines. The blend of Gears of War like game play (the main difference being a more complex melee system and not being able to take cover) with a DOOM like execution system leads to some absolutely amazing fights where you're truly living out your power fantasy of being a Space Marine always on the edge of defeat but ripping and tearing dozens enemies with extreme prejudice and when its over and your character is covered in blood and surrounded by Xenos corpses, you feel a rush not many other games give you.\n\nIn terms of modes, the story is very fun with some great moments but doesn't have a whole lot of reason to replay it. The main replayability comes from operations mode where you and 2 other friends choose from 6 classes. With these classes you will earn new perks for your character and weapons as you play 8 missions (so far) that run parallel to the main story but contain randomly generated encounters that keep things fresh for multiple playthroughs. As you increase your level you will be able to increase the difficulty and face tougher enemies with bigger rewards. Finally we have PVP where I think Saber made its biggest misstep in this game. The PVP itself is incredibly fun and they truly have something special here, the problem is the content. There are only 3 modes that can be played on 3 maps, that's it. It truly is a shame that they haven't done more with this mode. Its fortunate that the PVE in this game is so good because 3 maps is a pathetically small amount of content for such a fun mode and its unfortunate that the devs aren't planning on adding anything to PVP until sometime first quarter next year. I feel by that point the interest in the mode will have completely fizzled out.\n\nTo end on a positive note the graphics and scenery in this game are truly amazing and many times I found myself just admiring my surroundings.

Like nearly all other 40k games SM2 gets the atmosphere of the setting right and is overprized and underdelivers in gameplay aspects. Both gunplay and melee combat are mediocre at best. Level design and your options to traverse through them is poor, yes the levels \"wear\" a shiny coat of 40k related decorations but then you'll find yourself stopped by tiny fences and the levels are nothing but disguised tubes. Gameplay wise, on top of everything the game doesn't do anything with the concept of the main character being a space marine. The character is taller than the regular humans running around but what he does is the same. No amazing feats of strength, marksmanship, speed or tactical acumen here.\n\nPlaying Titus is like playing a character from early 3D adventure games, he moves slow, he changes weapons slow, he carries a pistol, a rifle and a melee weapon and he'll never get any interesting weapons because the game limits itself to standard shooter equivalents - slow shooting rifle, fast shooting rifle, shotgun, heavy weapon that fires fast, heavy weapon that fires in an arc.\n\nMelee is limited in its own way. You have one button for attacking, keep it pressed for an AOE attack and you can dodge and block/parry. There are indicators for special attacks you can and can't parry but you can also parry regular attacks, overall it feels like the devs liked the Arkham Batman games but didn't want to commit to that style of combat. In theory you have combos but in practice you'll never need them. Every regular encounter will find you surrounded by tiny enemies with one or two bigger ones.\n\nEvery \"boss\" fight is nothing but a slog against a bullet sponge (even on the lowest difficulty).\n\nStory wise - well, it is a 40k story, which means uninspired and basic and if anyone says they were suprised by Leandros from the first game showing up at the end, I'll call them a liar, not that there is any emotional weight to him revealing himself, the game does nothing to earn that, actually it does less than nothing - if you haven't played the first Space Marine game you won't have any clue why this guy should matter\n\nAlso get used to the idea that Titus has brain damage and makes a lot of very silly call-outs to his team - like warning them that there are enemies in a facility after you just fought a bunch at the entry of said facility", "timestamp_created": 1734841372, "timestamp_updated": 1734843699, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182978159": {"recommendationid": "182978159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041226818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2540, "last_played": 1730764759}, "language": "english", "review": "Instead of another in depth, fully rounded out experience like SM1, you get this.

You can also see thinly veiled assets in the campaign that they just recycled into their Operations mode.

They will fight the enemies but they won't defend objectives when you are being swarmed and have to do things such as keeping enemies from trashing multiple generators or multiple antenna arrays.\n\nSpace Marine 2 is a D+ at worst and a C- at best. It is a miscarriage of a game.\n\nEvery single mission in the campaign is a repeat of a particular template. Advance across a map populated by three types of enemies, Tyranid Hormagaunts, Termagaunts, Warriors, and occasionally the odd Lictor or Ravener.  Shoot them, hack and slash, move from one execution performance to another to boost shields and armor. Take some key feature, power up a console by interacting with it, then hold against waves that try to damage generators, antenna arrays, or elevator chains\u2026 None of the missions have any unique flavor.\n\nIf you're into the Warhammer 40k universe, especially the lore, you're much better off with Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine (1st game) or Warhammer 40,000 Death Watch.\n\nSpace Marine 2 is way over-typed and it simply isn't enjoyable, it plays like something that was poorly thought out, poorly coded, with a poor interface, slapped together, and rushed to the market to cash in on the success of the first Space Marine game. It does not contribute productively to the Space Marine franchise. It is just a naked cash grab.\n\nI will say, on the plus side for Space Marine 2, the down time periods between missions, the time spent on the Space Marine\u2019s Battle Barge, the graphics, the scenery, the surroundings, are amazing and spectacular. It is truly immersive and you actually feel like you are a Space Marine roaming around on the ship preparing to deploy to smash the enemies of mankind. The atmosphere on the Battle Barge is definitely the Grim Dark of the 40K universe. It is unfortunate that this atmosphere is taking place in a boring clunky game with an uninspired plot that is just a repackaged rehash of stuff that was already done earlier and elsewhere.\n\nI have tried hard to like this game as I am a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe and especially the lore. However, this game is clunky, combat is an uninspired slog, the missions are dull, repetitive, bland, unimaginative, and cliche.

TBH I enjoyed the campaign immensely however it was too short for me. Next game I hope they implement more single player things, such as custom character, maybe some RPG aspects, please someone else besides a fracking Ultramarine, enough smurfs. Decent ride just would not have bought the pass if I knew before hand the details. Overall id give a 7 out of 10. Great for the single player but not the price. The core game mechanics and game play are above par and feel amazing. I would have enjoyed more of the co-op and pvp but I dont want to play the same 6 missions and maps for 20 hours to unlock what I want. I would not recommend until they fix the pass details.

I beat the game on the hardest difficulty both in the story and in the co-op operations on every single level. I have all but two achievements except getting all the collectibles  and the other is getting every achievement. I maxed every class and fully upgraded all the weapons I was interested in. I've made some pretty optimal builds and don't really struggle at all on any class, any difficulty, or any map in the co-op so I'm not sure what all the other reviews gripes are about the combat. They nerfed the fencing mechanic but it still doesn't seem very hard at all, tried the new map on lethality difficulty and got it done first try, no deaths(only played the new map twice, super boring). The game just isn't built for longevity and the game play loop gets boring very fast. I played the newest Dark Angel update just enough to unlock all the new cosmetics and now won't touch the game until the next content update. The pvp is done very poorly and I'm not sure why but it seems like they need to add some beefiness to the pvp or something. I think adding stim packs would make the marines last longer because as of right now if you get beamed by one person you die pretty fast, let alone two people. I think the game could benefit from a gears and war duck and cover system because it just feels clunky, however I understand the space marines are in huge armor suits but honestly that's just what the game is missing in my opinion. I think a clamber and jump ability would also be great because again, the game-play just feels slow and clunky. Space marines are supposed to be agile and fast but they feel very grandpa like. I had high hopes for the game but the player count is just 10k on steam right now and that's not looking good at all. Save your money until the game is discounted, it's just not worth it in it's current state.
