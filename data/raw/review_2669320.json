[/b]\n\n[h2] Let\u2019s talk about the gameplay [/h2] [b] It\u2019s the most scripted, broken mess I\u2019ve ever played. In extra time, the AI turns into an unstoppable force, always scoring a last-minute equalizer or the winning goal like clockwork. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019ve been dominating for 90 minutes; the game always finds a way to snatch a victory from me and make all my efforts feel pointless. The game actively punishes you for trying to win and turns your time into a complete waste. [/b]\n\n[b] The actual gameplay mechanics are painfully slow, clunky, and downright boring. Everything feels sluggish, as if I\u2019m playing in slow motion. The players don\u2019t respond like they should, and simple tasks like dribbling or passing feel like a struggle.

At this stage, I\u2019m not asking for fancy new features or improvements\u2014I\u2019m literally just begging for a working game that doesn\u2019t fall apart after an hour of gameplay. How hard is it to create a game that doesn\u2019t require constant restarts and frustration? EA has completely dropped the ball, and I\u2019m done.

I am beyond disappointed, and I\u2019ll never recommend this game to anyone. If you value your time, your money, and your sanity, stay far away from this disaster.

While I can't comment on the yearly visual upgrades and the overall changes to the game presentation, it does feel it's closer to a real football game than ever before. While graphically the engine feels a bit outdated in certain areas, the implementation of various scenes before games, the attention to detail that are present in the audio and video presentation of teams is top-notch. Most teams home ground do feel unique, having unique songs, chants, stadium presenters, mascots and the like. This happens in most top leagues and while they were present in previous games, they seem to be at an all time high quality wise. \n\nHowever, downsides also come with this approach, as you'll sometimes feel a bit disconnected from actual gameplay and will feel as there are way too many cutscenes and visual interruptions to properly play the game. There just seems to be a lot of fluff to cover up some gameplay holes that have not been fixed for years and have been overlooked once again. But I'll get to that. \n\nVisually, the game is impressive. Stadiums, crowds, pitches and replays looks awesome. They feel well connected and everything just seems to be visually pleasing both by individual elements, as well as the sum of their parts. It's a cohesive visual direction which suits the game greatly. \n\nAudio is a mixed bag however. While the sound making up the atmosphere is pretty great, with crowds and stadium cheers sounding great, stadium songs for certain clubs are greatly produced and even stadium announcers seem to talk more and have more information than you'd think they would in a videogame, other aspects are lacking. The sounds of a player kicking the ball, the goalkeeper saving a shot, or the ball hitting the post, just sound a bit dull and repetitive. They're also the ones we've known for years. And talking about repetitive, the commentators seem to be getting worse and worse as each new game in the series has launched. Gone are the days of Andy Watson and Ally McCoist. There just doesn't seem to ever be a sense of occasion or real excitement from the commentators. Their performance is bland, dull and repetitive. While other audio elements can shine, commentators have been so disappointing that I ended up turning them off. The music in the menus doesn't even deserve a mention, completely forgettable. \n\nGameplay has always mattered the most. It also seems to be the one thing about the game that hasn't really changed much over the years. Can you really notice much change year-by-year? I can't, it just plays and feels like any other FIFA from the past few years. There are still things that don't really work. Headers are still extremely weak for instance. I can't, for the life of me, seem to be able to score from a cross. Ever. Passing has also not changed much. It's still imprecise, especially in tight areas. Players often feel clunky, they rarely seem to move as fast as AI players. They always stumble on the ball much more, they always feel like they're just missing a beat, a step behind. Passing can be frustrating, but not only because passing itself can feel cumbersome from the imprecise controls, but also because players you are trying to pass to almost never do what you'd expect them to do. If you're trying to pass to a player making a run, it will happen well too often for that player to stop his run and turn back, only to miss the ball because it runs too far and he turned back. The only reason you're passing to him in the first place is because he's making a run. But he just stops. There are situations where a player is coming towards you and you'll pass to where he will be by the time the ball reaches him, but he'll suddenly start running backwards, away from the ball, thus losing the ball and the AI intercepting. All these small moments, among various others, happen way too often to think passing actually works. It gets frustrating, considering the fact that this has been happening for years and not much has changed. The problem is caused mostly by the unpredictability of the player you are passing to, not the passing itself. Players just seem to have a mind of their own. Another issue that's been present for years has been the inability of your team to go forward. Players will stay close to you, fullbacks won't run forward and make runs, no matter what your tactics are. Counter attacks can sometimes work. Those are some of the greatest parts of the game, you can score by having three passes in total, from your own box to scoring a goal. But those moments happen too rarely, because most of the time, your players don't go forward, don't make runs (only forwards do), are always too close to the player with the ball. \n\nI feel there are too many issues similar to these that make the experience not worthwhile. I could go on about the offside still not working properly all the time or the way too often moments of the AI players and yours just bumping into eachother, with the AI always getting away with the ball in every situation. There are too many things that just don't work and haven't been addressed in years. \n\nSome things do work better than before. Defending has never felt better. DM's and CM's are vital in defending and I've never had as much fun defending in a FIFA game. Pressing is a mechanic that you will have to learn if you're not used to it, as it is key to successful defending. It's also neat that it works great and is dependable. The way in which you can force the AI into mistakes and block passing lanes has never felt so satisfying. Tackles also feel heavy and impactful. Shooting isn't half bad, it can feel imprecise at times, but feels improved and reliable in most situations. Free kicks are quite fun and corner kicks have never felt as precise. \n\nThe game has too many elements to properly address in a short review like this. Overall, it feels lacking because it hasn't had a proper gameplay revamp in years. While the visual presentation is top notch, the gameplay is so subpar in comparison, that you'd think the game is 15 years older than it actually is. I wouldn't recommend the game unless at a steep discount. If you're a fan of the series and have played it annually, you know exactly what you're getting into. It's such a shame there is no real competition for the series anymore. Competition has always brought innovation, but as things stand, we'll be saying the same things about the next game in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1734729653, "timestamp_updated": 1734729653, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53468698263168335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182937077": {"recommendationid": "182937077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353479391", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1734164480}, "language": "english", "review": "The stuttering was so horrible that I was forced to refund the game, it was literally unplayable.
