One of the most heartbreaking changes was the removal of the Arenas mode. For many players, Arenas was a perfect mix of strategy and fast-paced action, offering a break from the intensity of the Battle Royale format. The 3v3 setup fostered teamwork and skill-building, creating a space for players to sharpen their abilities and bond with their squads. Losing it feels like losing a piece of what made Apex special.\n\nThese days, many in the community point to the game\u2019s struggles with balancing new features, a shift toward monetization over meaningful updates, and a lack of focus on the player experience. Some criticize the developers for not addressing gameplay issues like matchmaking and player retention, which have driven away casual fans. Others feel like the removal of Arenas and other features is part of a broader trend of the game becoming overly sweaty and less fun for the average player\u200b.\n\nRespawn Entertainment has faced challenges in adapting to its community's needs, and while updates aim to innovate, they often feel like they miss the mark. Many of us miss the good old days when Apex Legends was just pure, thrilling fun\u2014a game that kept us coming back for the camaraderie and unique gameplay. Now, the game feels more like it\u2019s chasing trends rather than staying true to what made it great.\n\nI hope Respawn finds a way to reignite the spark that once made Apex such a standout title. Until then, I\u2019ll keep missing the Arenas and the golden era of Apex Legends.\n", "timestamp_created": 1734331660, "timestamp_updated": 1734331660, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182852227": {"recommendationid": "182852227", "author": {"steamid": "76561199561944085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 65274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65274, "last_played": 1733501111}, "language": "english", "review": "The best shooter game in wrong hands.

The game overcrowded with cheaters of all kind from wallhackers and hipfire obliteraters to other devices such as cronus, reasnow, xim.

And, developers busy selling for a 100th time their recolored skins but not making any good to the game. My friends and I play a much better game than apex now as it has few cheaters because there's no ranking in it. No aim assist advantage over mnk too - The Hunt Showdown. Even Post Malone quit apex and have played over 400 hours already plus they made a collaboration with him in the recent battle pass.

It was my first game with all achievements on Steam (though that means very little) and it\u2019s my most played game on Steam with more than double my next most played, but it is not as fun as it used to be. Close to 900 of my 1500 hours came in a single year (2021), but since then I\u2019ve played very little. \n\nI\u2019ll give it credit that it is a free game, and a relatively unique BR game (as far as I know). However, it has a lot of expensive monetization, the quality of the game has decreased, it can be quite overwhelming for newer players with so many characters to face, poor balancing, and sometimes rough matchmaking. It definitely gives you the chance to make cool, fun plays. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to have the skill and want to learn it to improve, then it can feel personally rewarding if you\u2019re into that (no actual rewards of course). And if you care for Steam achievements, there are 12 of them, which are relatively attainable and are mostly based on playing the game enough, plus having enough luck or skill to win 8 total games which isn\u2019t too bad. \n\nOverall, I\u2019d say the game is not worth playing much anymore, because of its downwards trend in quality over time, and how it can get frustrating or boring (though I admit, I probably played way too much at one point). I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend playing to most people.

All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

I've played over 2000+ hours on console since end of S2 up till the very current season. On console no matter how many master and predator players I encounter, it felt like a challenge more to keep up with them rather than being frustrated. However, on PC despite encountering the same situation and my aim not being that good since i just moved over to PC. The problem lies with teammates. I don't mind encountering high levels players and getting destroyed by their movement and aim but, my teammates are supposedly the same level as me being Prestige 1 level 300+ are playing far worse than me? They can't aim properly, have low match IQ, and some have reached master? It goes to show that stats don't really matter. Playing ranked feels like a dumpster fire at times when I'm matching against diamonds and masters but have silver or low gold players. At the end of the day, no matter how terrible this game gets, I will always come back to play it.

The addition of arenas in Season 9 was also nice to give players more options, even if it wasn't popular.\n\nUnfortunately, this game has done very little over the years to expand upon itself and now serves as a playhouse for EA to rub their nipples and dump their greedy practices onto its player-base...
