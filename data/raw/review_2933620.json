The reason being is the use of Generative AI and the recent VA concerns with AI.\n\nFor those that don't know, Julie Nathanson (the Voice Actress for Samantha, whose been doing it since World at War), the whole Zombies Crew, and multiple other Voice Actors left and went on strike as Activision has no AI protections under their contracts. And before anyone says \"Oh well, this doesn't affect you, why do you care?\"\n\nIt does. As someone whose been playing Call of Duty since the original Modern Warfare, and has been with the Zombies story since World at War, it pains me to see characters who were either original to the character (Julie and Nolan North), or new actors doing a banging job with the characters they were voicing (like Maya or Weaver). These are their jobs, and due to the nature of the amount of voice lines they would have to record, this was most likely their main job with others being side gigs. This hurts them financially, as they wouldn't be getting paid or benefit from it if AI took their jobs.\n\nAnd there is blatant Generative AI art in the game, and no, I'm not talking about the six-finger zombie santa. There are multiple bundles, all around 20-30 dollars in price, selling emblems, calling cards, and loading screens that are blatant AI (another notable case is the loading screen from the Parasite Bundle. Based on the character's feet, they're looking towards us, but their torso, head, and left arm would indicate they're looking away, but their right arm would indicate they're looking towards us. A second case is a lone-fucking spear in the middle of a gladiator army standing upright, where from how they're holding the spears and shields you would think are facing towards you. But they are actually facing away from you based off of their torsos and head).\n\nThey could have done what Fortnite does and hire multiple artists, and have them create artwork for the game. Getting art commissioned by someone usually isn't expensive (to a development studio at least). Yet, this change to Generative AI most likely costed 4-6 artists to lose their jobs, which benefit no one in the end (and instead harm the developers).\n\nAnd to anyone still saying \"So...\"\n\nI know you don't care, and that's because you don't put a drop of effort into your life to follow a passion or dream career. But just imagine if you followed your dream career, developed your expertise and gained experience, only for you to lose it all because some new technology came out and companies went \"We don't need you anymore,\" getting rid of an amazing talent and instead giving consumers slop.", "timestamp_created": 1734518101, "timestamp_updated": 1734518101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585074961185455322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182705678": {"recommendationid": "182705678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235339276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "AI-Infested disease of a game.

You should not buy this game unless you were a fan of Cold War zombies, or exclusively played \"that one theater map in black ops 1\"\n\nIf you're a fan of the BO2 -> BO4 zombies there is nothing for you here. All of the systems introduced in Cold War were brought forwards. There is no strategy, depth or nuance to gameplay anymore. Everything has been streamlined into a flat experience devoid of the original game modes replayability.\n\nAt the time of this review all three of the available maps are incredibly shallow. They feature little to differentiate themselves on a gameplay level aside from the wonder weapons. The most complicated map we've seen features four elemental wonder weapons, each with 1 to 2 step sequences for acquisition. Two out of three of the maps don't feature the power system. None of the Pack-A-Punch quests have surpassed Der Reise in complexity. At the rate we're going, I'm afraid we're never going to see another map like Mob of the Dead, Origins or Shadows of Evil again. Treyarch seems too afraid to implement maps with deep learning curves because it'll scare off their casual audience\n\nIn a classic display of anti-consumer practices, zombies requires a constant internet connection to play. Yes, even in a singleplayer game. I've had numerous moments where a lag spike will send my character flying off the map, only to get snapped back and downed because the zombies got a chance to surround me. The always online requirement also doesn't play well with the increased aggressiveness that zombies have. Zombies are capable of chunking your healthbar at higher rounds, which means any lagspike or microstutter near a horde can be a deathblow\n\nThe game also restricts the amount of time you're allowed to keep the game paused for. If you ever spend a sum total of fifteen minutes paused during a zombies session, the game will either disable the pause functionality or save and quit the game. You are no longer allowed to pause the game and step away for more than 15 minutes without fully closing out the game session\n\nAlso this game is slowly being polluted with AI art slop\n\nI can't recommend this game in good faith to anyone but the most surface level of Call of Duty players, but they aren't the kind of people to read this far down a review anyways", "timestamp_created": 1734577687, "timestamp_updated": 1734577792, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182689865": {"recommendationid": "182689865", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199590453", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I was holding out hope for this, finally an actually decent Call of Duty that felt made by people.

Xmas event that makes people think you need to buy \"Blackcell\" right in the middle of the items you purchase with \"Archies\". Putting certain weapons behind the battle pass - can't get without it. - Dishonest practices\n-  Weed / marijuana pot leaf smoke animation when people get kills with certain operator skin etc.  Promotion or encouragement of drugs to so many kids they know play this game that are under 18 is sickening\n-  Having a separate launcher to play Black ops 6\n-  Poor customer support when there are issues, purposely making it hard to get help with product once it is purchased\n-  No accountability with giving out game bans.  Know friends that don't hack that now have permanently had their steam accounts of 15+ years in good standing and building +rep ruined.  Reputation tarnished forever because of bs algorithms that \"catch hacking\" with no legit way to appeal, explain or get proof of their actions - no accountability to public.\n-  Previous methods by activision in other games have had microtransactions that were \"legalized\" gambling with \"buying crates\" in order to gain certain things in the game, including weapons.\n-  All CoD titles put out by Acitivision are designed to die in a year so as to make people not have enough ppl to queue with and buy the next new CoD title.\n-  The time to kill in Black Ops and a lot of the new titles are way too slow (TTK).  Game favors console player with slow TTK and aim assist - unlike older CoD titles.  TTK is so trash, people go to play in Hardcore mode to level up weapons or play in zombies.\n-  All the different skins make it hard to distinguish between enemy and friendly at times\n-  Honestly, I see Activision ruining the future games and one day have to answer for all the borderline illegal stuff they do, likely finding themselves in a class action law suit and someday laws to prevent future abuse, taking advantage of consumers.\n-  They take away maps like \"Stakeout\" that people want to play all the time and force them to play other stuff they dont want, manipulating people's time and enjoyment for their own purposes.\n-  Number of players on map should be increased IMO - 6v6 too little when many of us played 9v9 for years on bo1 nuketown 24/7\n-  Kill streaks are meh\n-  Many of the operator skins are not attractive towards all audiences.  Seems to favor a certain \"mindset\" of political correctness or fear of reprisal.  \n\nCons related to zombies\n-  Activision has lost sight of what made zombies good.  \n-  Zombies have health bars\n-  You dont build up from nothing like in OG zombies... with a pistol and have to use strategy if you decide to buy wall gun or go for box... or go for bowie knife to maximize early points.\n-  There are weapon caches around the map that make it feel less immersive like other aspects of old zombies they changed.\n-  One of black ops 3 favorite zombies maps \"Der eisendrache...\" with bows had jump pads, teleports and other cool stuff happening on map.  Other bo3 maps a lot of thought, effort went into making great maps... the story and immersion with the characters & their one liner sayings helped as well... Those all seem lost or not done well enough to standards people expected after bo3 zombies.\n\nPros - Specific to Black ops 6\n-  omni-movement is satisfying\n-  progress between zombies and multiplayer for weapons and prestige are combined\n-  when prestiging, do not lose weapon leveling progress\n-  New stakeout map is fun\n-  Few other map designs are also well done, not too big etc.\n-  They dont have silly \"ultimate\" (overwatch-like) abilities like in previous titles \"heatwave... gravity spikes etc\"\n\nWhile nostalgia and some of the old enjoyable parts of the game remain intact for me, the ultimate agenda and actions of activision do not warrant my support.

This game's development started last October at the earliest.\n\n90-95% of all earnable calling cards, emblems, and purchasable bundles in-store utilize AI generated art and contain multiple visual anomalies. Things awkwardly fade together, make no sense in terms of perspective, anatomy is god awful, anything a junior artist would do better, is done worse in this game's presentation. \"Four years of development\", and we were given AI generated slop.\n\nPerformance is at an all-time low. The minimum specs required on this title are an absolute lie. After being able to play MWIII for a year straight with an incredibly solid, fluid framerate, Black Ops 6 barely gets 40 FPS on my machine at the lowest settings, using barely any VRAM. The game stutters and lags and glitches visually in ways that make it incredibly unsatisfying and frustrating to play. \"Four years of development\", and the game is incredibly unstable.\n\nThe game launched with 33 guns, the same as MWIII, which was a borderline DLC for MWII and carried forward every weapon from that game as well. \"Four years of development\", and we were given the same amount of weapons as a game that was made in less than one year.\n\nThe game lacks game modes in multiplayer. While sledgehammer brought back classics such as Safeguard (escort), Demolition, Capture the Flag, War, and experimented with more unique game modes such as G3T H1GH3R in MWIII, Treyarch has opted instead to take out all of the fan favorite modes we received last year in favor of the mundane ones that every COD title has. Hardpoint, Dom, and that's about it when it comes to respawn modes. \"Four years of development\", and players have no game modes to choose from.\n\nThe maps are abysmal. I have not played with a single person who finds any of the maps in this game enjoyable to any capacity. Treyarch in 2024 is unfortunately entirely incompetent when it comes to designing enjoyable, fleshed out, well-flowing maps, and instead creates a giant plane with a mish-mash of objects to create some semblance of cover. The spawns are horrible, the maps have zero flow and are unsatisfying, and being an objective player feels worse than ever. \"Four years of development\", and we are given quite possibly the worst call of duty launch maps of all time.\n\nI do not believe Treyarch is the development juggernaut they were a decade ago. They now underdeliver, lie to their fanbase, insult their intelligence through usage of AI, and create unstable buggy messes. As somebody who has unlocked both Nebula camo, Dark Matter camo, and reached prestige master in BO6, I would recommend you wait until about halfway through season 2 or maybe even season 3 before considering spending your money.

pretty, yeah yeah. it does feel kind of hollow though. the campaign doesnt deal with (if botched) historical events as much as black ops entries past, the multiplayer lobbies still disband every game for reasons unknown, and a single screenshot of zombies speaks for itself. \n\ni had my dumb fun with this game, and you could too if youre looking for a quick, dumb, classic call of duty experience,

(singleplayer) feels like a filler game, like Cold War + recent MW3 but without all the cool elements and story telling.\nNow they got expensive equipments to pump out as many 3D models, maps, this whole thing felt like just a MW3 reskin with few interaction options.\nThere's even a \"Al Mazra\" style map with some killstreaks, the whole game play felt like killing SNPCs in Garry's Mod.\n\nIn the first mission you can immediately notice you cannot break a car's headlight, and in later missions you cannot do a lot of things that used to work, nothing like the good old games when the Battlefield and Call of Duty are competing each other...\nThis is a souless cash grab.\n\nThis game is 2/10.\nI started since WaW, was a big fan of MW2 and BO series, now both franchise has died, RIP COD.\n\n\n*****Edit*****\nI just finished the story, it felt like they just went with every pitch the dev team made, like a college student's project, the story is not refined or polished, I'll break it into 3 parts without spoiling too much.\n\n1. Early game: Immediately you'll notice the lack of details in environments and map props, though it's different title and studio but they added a lot of details in MW2 reboot's world, it was not present in BO6. \nUpon arriving the safehouse, you'll notice how easy the puzzle is, like I said they just went with every ideas devs made, so they took lockpicking from Skyrim, safe codes puzzle but way easier with just channeling a radio then it will read what the code is to you, then a Wordle code guessing puzzle which is kinda fun but makes no sense to the keypad hacking.\nThe majority puzzle is child's play and makes no sense, it almost felt insulting.\n\n2. Mid game: there is many filler missions that just give you a map and tell you to explore some point of interests, that will give you killstreak rewards, radio records and a few interactions that doesn't effect the story.\n\n3. Late game: OK, so we have a backstory now? what the heck is all this that doesn't really matter afterwards? and why is this other character important now? why should I care about their \"misunderstood\" backstory? I just don't care for anything about character.\nAnd of course there is some level of girl bossing, COD gone woke isn't news but it doesn't really fit the theme here.\n\n\nConclusion the future of COD doesn't look so bright to me if they keep doing fast cash grabs and stopped refining stories.\n\nBO6 doesn't have that blood rush in WaW, OG MW2.\n\nBO6 doesn't have the sick musics like WaW, OG MW2, BO1, BO2 and Cold War.\n\nBO6 doesn't have an interesting world view or story telling like WaW, OG MW2, MW1 reboot, Advanced Warfare, Cold War.\n\nBO6 doesn't have improvements of mechanics like AW, MW2 reboot, Cold War.", "timestamp_created": 1734627256, "timestamp_updated": 1734885384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531652987003326416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183480818": {"recommendationid": "183480818", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090150139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "gonna boycott this shit im playing call of duty since WAW and never expierenced a bullshit like this.

Be prepared to use only PG-13 language because this game is more sensitive than any human being you've ever met. Next, 90% of the maps are actual utter garbage, it's actually quite embarrassing.

I only ever bought to play the zombies and it is genuinely a lot of fun. 9/10 for zombies. I have yet to play the campaign, but i have heard good things about it. My issues boiling down to two things: The multiplayer and the use of AI in cosmetics. First off, the multiplayer. The last time I played multiplayer was Black Ops 4 way back in 2018. Ever since the new engine with MW19 and skill based matchmaking, I refuse to play the multiplayer. I know full well I will play one good game and get my ass handed to me for the next 3 games. Plus with the new omnimovement system, which is good for zombies and campaign, only makes people ever more frustrating to play against. My second, and far more pressing issue, as well as the main reason I am leaving a negative review, is due to the recent use of Ai in the cosmetics. I have always hated Activision. Always putting money first, and qaulity and its own employees second. But now, they are MULTI BILLION dollar company, and they choosing not only to use AI over real artists for cosmetics, but also replace the voice actors with AI to save what i can only assume is pennies! Julie Nathanson has been the voice of Samantha Maxis since World at War, and they just replaced with a shitty AI voice, because she refused to work under the pretense that she could be replaced with AI in the future. None of the other voice actors are safe either. Nolan North is at real risk of being replaced by AI. The current state of Activision is absolutely fucking abysmal.

The campaign is amazing with unique missions, a great story, and that unmistakable Treyarch/Raven vibe. Zombies is also the best it has been since BO3, with great maps, returning and new systems that feel fun to play, and great progression. Multiplayer is also great, with omni-movement feeling like a great way to freshen up the movement formula. The guns, loadouts, and classic progression system feel like a proper polished multiplayer experience. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend buying the game in it's current state. It suffers two main issues: corporate greed and an inconsistent gameplay experience. \n\nCorporate greed has been present in CoD for a long time. While the systems aren't as predatory as they were in the lootbox era, there are many systems that rub you the wrong way. The overpriced cosmetics, lack of investment into game infrastructure and use of generative AI slop is peak Activision greed in action. I don't mind them offering cosmetics, but when every skin is a laser show that costs $30 and ruins any consistent aesthetic the game had in the beta, you have to know that the battlepass and store will always be their top priority.\n\nCircling back to game infrastructure and inconsistency in gameplay, this probably the main reason I would cannot recommend this game. When the game works, it is more fun than I have had with a CoD title in a long time, with me actually getting to prestige for the first time in over a decade. However, the game is has a passable consistency at best and maliciously sandbags you or is unplayable at worst. Look up terms like 'packet burst', 'skill based damage', and 'EOMM' and you will see that there is something deeply broken at the core of this game. You will be mid-match with a perfect connection and top of the line PC but the game randomly start feeling like you playing on McDonald's wifi or your guns start taking forever to kill. Call this latency issues, CPU overload or hit registration, but this definitely speaks to something being wrong on the server end and we can't rule out that it isn't intentional. Additionally, for the solo zombies players, this issue affects you too because solo zombies games are ONLINE. So there is potential you will get a packet burst and go down at a high round due to the Activision servers deciding that it was your time to go.\n\nOverall, the game needs work.
