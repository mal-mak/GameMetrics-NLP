While both games excel at open-world adventures, it\u2019s Red Dead Online\u2019s unique charm, atmosphere, and sense of adventure that make it shine as a standout experience.\n\nAt its core, Red Dead Online offers players the chance to live in a meticulously crafted Wild West. The sprawling landscapes, from snow-capped mountains to vast plains dotted with wild animals, make every journey feel like a true exploration. Whether you're galloping on horseback across a golden sunset or hunting in the dense forests, the sense of immersion is unmatched. The environment itself feels like a living, breathing entity, where nature and humanity coexist in ways that feel organic. In GTA Online, the urban sprawl and high-speed chases can become monotonous, but Red Dead Online\u2019s world offers endless moments of peaceful solitude or high-stakes excitement in equal measure.\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Red Dead Online is its slower pace, which allows players to appreciate the finer details. It\u2019s not all about high-octane action; there\u2019s room for crafting, fishing, hunting, and living off the land. This slower, more deliberate approach allows for storytelling and moments of calm\u2014something that often gets lost in the frantic pace of GTA Online. Here, you can enjoy long rides through forests or take a break by a quiet river, relishing in the beauty of the surroundings. It's a place where you can just *be*, far from the hustle and bustle of city life, without feeling rushed to complete missions.\n\nThe role-playing aspect of Red Dead Online also sets it apart. While GTA Online allows for chaos, heists, and street racing, Red Dead Online takes a more thematic approach to gameplay. Players can choose from roles such as bounty hunter, trader, collector, or moonshiner\u2014each with its own rich story and progression system. These roles feel deeply integrated into the world, giving each player a unique path and sense of purpose. The storylines, steeped in the gritty realism of the era, offer far more than just the occasional shootout or car chase; they\u2019re about survival, camaraderie, and the harsh realities of life in a lawless land.\n\nAdditionally, Red Dead Online fosters a different kind of community. The stakes feel higher when you're working together to capture a bounty or protect a trading convoy, and there's a real sense of cooperation and camaraderie among players. The world encourages players to interact meaningfully rather than just compete against each other. In contrast, GTA Online can sometimes feel like a constant cycle of violence and destruction, with players focused on beating each other at every turn.\n\nWhat truly elevates Red Dead Online above GTA Online, though, is its storytelling and atmosphere. The music, the voice acting, the ambiance\u2014it all comes together to create a world that feels alive, echoing the themes of loss, redemption, and survival. There\u2019s an emotional depth that GTA Online, with its neon lights and over-the-top antics, can\u2019t quite replicate.\n\nIn conclusion, Red Dead Online isn\u2019t just an online game; it\u2019s a world to immerse yourself in. It offers an experience that combines the beauty of the Wild West with rich narratives, slower-paced exploration, and a unique sense of community that outshines the more frantic, high-energy world of GTA Online. It\u2019s a masterpiece that stands as one of the most captivating multiplayer experiences out there, inviting players to step into a world full of stories, adventure, and breathtaking beauty.", "timestamp_created": 1735018387, "timestamp_updated": 1735018387, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183540721": {"recommendationid": "183540721", "author": {"steamid": "76561199263030327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 409, "playtime_at_review": 1396, "last_played": 1735045419}, "language": "english", "review": "every thing about this game is majestic. the graphics the story everything.", "timestamp_created": 1735018290, "timestamp_updated": 1735018290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183540666": {"recommendationid": "183540666", "author": {"steamid": "76561199285432299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "playtime_at_review": 5307, "last_played": 1735056861}, "language": "english", "review": "Friking incredible", "timestamp_created": 1735018200, "timestamp_updated": 1735018200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183540317": {"recommendationid": "183540317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263245246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1150, "playtime_at_review": 1150, "last_played": 1734972928}, "language": "english", "review": "Should be called Grand Theft Auto: Old West.", "timestamp_created": 1735017800, "timestamp_updated": 1735017800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183539982": {"recommendationid": "183539982", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086850775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3384, "playtime_at_review": 5018, "last_played": 1734999932}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah yup yes", "timestamp_created": 1735017393, "timestamp_updated": 1735017393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183539338": {"recommendationid": "183539338", "author": {"steamid": "76561199354489658", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1962, "playtime_at_review": 1948, "last_played": 1735017413}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun!!!

No, 11/10!\r\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is, without a doubt, the greatest game I have ever played. The dynamic world, the jaw-dropping visuals, and the gripping story make this game a masterpiece. But what really sets it apart is Arthur Morgan, the most immersive and well-developed main character ever created in gaming.\r\nThe attention to detail in this game is nothing short of incredible. The physics, especially the Rockstar physics, are revolutionary. The way everything interacts, from animals to the environment, makes the world feel so alive. And speaking of animals\u2014the variety of species, fish, and wildlife is unmatched. It\u2019s a hunting, fishing, and exploring paradise!\r\nBut that\u2019s not all. There\u2019s so much to do, from tons of side quests to hidden easter eggs scattered throughout. The NPCs have their own lives, routines, and conversations, making the world feel truly alive. Every corner holds something new, whether it\u2019s a random encounter, a unique side mission, or a beautiful landscape to explore.\r\nYou should play this game. No doubt about it. It\u2019s not just a game; it\u2019s an experience.

"review": "Rating: 9/10 (Outstanding)\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most immersive, detailed, and emotionally resonant games ever made. While it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s an unforgettable journey through the dying days of the Wild West.\n\nWhat I Loved:\n\n    An Immersive World Like No Other:\n    Rockstar has crafted a world that feels alive in every sense. The frontier is vast, diverse, and brimming with detail\u2014from snow-capped mountains and dense forests to bustling towns and desolate plains. Every corner of the map feels handcrafted, with random events and encounters making the world feel dynamic. Simply riding through the wilderness is an experience in itself.\n\n    A Gripping, Emotional Story:\n    The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang is masterfully told. It\u2019s a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and the struggle to find redemption in a world that\u2019s leaving the outlaw lifestyle behind. Arthur is one of the most compelling protagonists in gaming, with a character arc that\u2019s both powerful and heartbreaking.\n\n    Unparalleled Attention to Detail:\n    RDR2 is a technical marvel. From the way mud clings to your boots to the way your horse\u2019s mane sways in the wind, every detail is meticulously crafted. NPCs have their own routines and react to your actions in believable ways, adding to the immersion. Even the little things, like cleaning your guns or shaving your beard, help sell the authenticity of the world.\n\n    Diverse Gameplay:\n    There\u2019s so much to do, from hunting legendary animals and playing poker to tracking bounties and robbing trains. The variety of activities ensures the game stays engaging, whether you\u2019re focused on the main story or just living life as an outlaw.\n\n    Incredible Audio and Visuals:\n    The visuals are breathtaking, with stunning lighting and landscapes that feel painterly. The sound design is equally impressive, with a memorable soundtrack and ambient sounds that bring the frontier to life. The voice acting, especially Roger Clark as Arthur, is phenomenal, elevating the emotional weight of the story.\n\nWhat I Didn\u2019t Love:\n\n    Slow Pacing:\n    RDR2 is deliberately slow, and while this works to immerse you in the world, it can be a barrier for some players. Animations are lengthy, travel takes time, and missions often unfold at a leisurely pace. If you\u2019re not patient, this might feel like a chore.\n\n    Clunky Controls and Mechanics:\n    While the game excels in realism, this sometimes comes at the expense of responsiveness. Arthur\u2019s movements can feel sluggish, and the controls, particularly in combat, can be frustratingly imprecise.\n\n    Repetition in Missions:\n    Many story missions follow a familiar formula: ride to a location, shoot your way out, escape. While the storytelling is top-notch, the gameplay within missions doesn\u2019t always match the same level of variety.\n\n    Open-World Fatigue:\n    With so much to do, the game can feel overwhelming. The sheer number of systems\u2014like managing your camp, maintaining your horse, and keeping Arthur fed and clean\u2014might feel unnecessary or tedious for some players.\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is a monumental achievement in gaming. Its story, world, and attention to detail set a new standard for open-world games. While the slow pacing and clunky mechanics may deter some players, those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most immersive and emotionally rich experiences in gaming.\n\nPros:\n\n    Stunning, immersive open world.\n    A powerful and emotional story with memorable characters.\n    Unmatched attention to detail in visuals, audio, and world-building.\n    Diverse gameplay activities that capture the essence of the Wild West.\n\nCons:\n\n    Slow pacing might frustrate impatient players.\n    Controls and mechanics can feel clunky.\n    Some repetitive mission structures.\n    Open-world systems might feel overwhelming or unnecessary.\n\nRecommendation:\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play for anyone who values storytelling, immersion, and a rich open world. It\u2019s not a game that rushes you\u2014it\u2019s one you savor. While not without its flaws, it\u2019s a masterpiece that deserves its place as one of the best games of its generation.", "timestamp_created": 1734716386, "timestamp_updated": 1734716386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182892931": {"recommendationid": "182892931", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982880552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1734356370}, "language": "english", "review": "Requires me to register for essentially what I wanted to play as single player game.\nNo way to avoid registration to play said single player only version of game.\nWont ever buy any rockstar games again.

In such a diverse and detailed environment, there should have been far more player-based choices available, and the forced linearity of the story seriously took away from the wild-west outlaw feel. Despite multiple endings, they\u2019re all relatively the same, and they\u2019re mostly determined by a single decision at the very end. The aim assist is also way too strong, creating a negative skill expression in comparison to every other game that exists. [I felt more skill expression from Backyard Baseball.] If you\u2019re new to gaming, looking for an escape, want a fishing simulator,  or want a peaceful environment to stroll through, this game is for you. If you\u2019re a serious gamer who seeks adrenaline surges and skill expression, this is absolutely not for you.\n\n===The Good==\n-Growing Storyline; learning new information feels natural\n-Proper Cowboy Humor\n-Horse Mechanics; only possible addition to the current design is hoof-work\n-Skinning Mechanics; accurate and adaptive-per-animal. Takes time, but not too much\n-DARK Dark\n-External research is not required for an encompassing Red Dead experience\n\n===The Bad===\n-Game Speed. Forced camp-walk is wildly irritating. Looting/Searching takes way too long for multiple reasons [including individualized animations, character cannot be moving when inputting \u2018search\u2019 function, character momentum dis-aligns \u2018search\u2019 function, etc.]. Following your allies is a huge waste of time. Fishing is accurate but takes too much effort and time. Forced walking in many random locations is pointless. Many urgent scenarios will leave you standing around/moving at minimum possible speed, and character animations have your avatar fumbling around for the right spot to interact in, long after your inputs.\n-Weapons disappearing. It\u2019s one thing for your weapons to be holstered after an extended period without use while on horseback, it\u2019s another to have no primary weapons equipped for multiple missions where your horse is also unavailable. Scavenging is always a great gameplay element, but you should have ready-access to the weapons you\u2019ve obtained, outside of situations like kidnapping and jail. \n-Menu Formatting. Who the hell designed these menus? Fire them. Brightness wasn\u2019t available anywhere in-game. You have General, Camera, Display, Graphics, NONE of these contain brightness, and somehow the most BASIC display function was buried in a terrible layout. \u2018Save\u2019 also isn\u2019t up-front, and the menus won\u2019t tell you why \u2018Save\u2019 is locked. The navigation system fails to understand your ability to traverse a topo-map, and sends you on goose chases instead of cutting through mountains. You have to pause to look at the map, also pausing recovery for your/horse\u2019s stamina bar[s] when it realistically should take place. However, the in-game maps actually function in this manner, causing further inconsistencies.\n-This game needs WAY more opportunities for player-based choices. It provides a bountiful number of playstyle options and storylines that got completely sidelined or overlooked. They\u2019re mildly present, but should be much more numerous, and should have far greater influence on the outcome of the storyline.\n-Save Mechanics. Manual save is available, but is buried within the menus when this should be an up-front feature in all games that involve saving. There is an autosave feature, but it doesn\u2019t activate before entering a no-save zone. More often than not, you can\u2019t save when you want to. Had multiple instances where I couldn\u2019t save in my own camp. Save files randomly reverted multiple times, forcing me to repeat the same missions and endure the ridiculously slow camp walk & runback times I\u2019ve already pushed through. \n-Stealth Failures. Allies will shout your name in the middle of a robbery. You robbed a bank with your sheriff\u2019s badge still on. You take the time to pick a new name and still choose \u201cArthur\u201d. You hear the farmer tell the deputies about the noise in the barn, but you can\u2019t leave? I kill the intruder with a knife, my gun-wielding allies flame me for making noise as they pop-off shots. Forced into a firefight from a tattered barn that would provide zero protection, forced to stay inside as the enemies are throwing molotovs. Dutch, your \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader is shouting your character\u2019s real name again during the biggest robbery. The brainlessness kills me as a stealth gamer, but what really upset me was: both before and after this mission, the house where the stranger reported the barn noises is actually boarded up and marked vacant for purpose of repossession. There was never anyone in this house. Karen calls Bill by name & Arthur takes his mask off in the bank during the robbery, BUT NOT HIS SHERIFF\u2019S BADGE? It\u2019s a criminally inaccurate depiction of what crime would actually require.\n-Aim assist is way too strong in this game. I pride myself on accuracy in shooters, and I struggled severely to get my reticle on any target other than my first, significantly reducing my accuracy due to the overcompensation required. This became more and more frustrating as I played the game because my intended targets were disregarded for a different enemy that was behind me/completely off-screen. \n\n===The Ugly==\n-Wagon wheel breaks, and we fix it by doing\u2026 nothing at all\n-Can\u2019t change/remove articles of clothing while riding\n-Multiple grammatical errors present in the first 2 chapters alone\n-Baby Deer survived 6 rounds of .44 magnum and ran away\n-Put a dead bullfrog in my bag?? And blood-soaked bird carcasses. With my biscuits and everything.\n-STATIONARY CANNON clips the walls, a clear lack of game-testing\n-Camping has way too many stipulations that prevent you from setting up, and most of the time it doesn\u2019t even tell you why, just \u201cCannot set up camp right now\u201d\n-1 quest directs me to commit a crime. Next quest cannot be started due to crimes committed in the previous quest. No forewarning provided\n-I guess Arthur can\u2019t swim\n-\u201cI don\u2019t speak German\u201d, then proceeds to understand multiple sentences in German\n-Calls to Action [assisting in kidnappings, police chases, etc.] do not yield the expected results, often end in negative consequences rather than positive ones\n-Attempting to reach my horse failed multiple missions due to proximity without warning\n-Attempting to kill a bounty\u2019s horse [before fleeing/mounting] failed the mission as \u201cSpooked\u201d\n-Firearms equipped on horseback that are not in use should remain in inventory when dismounting, not unequipped automatically. [Holstering would be acceptable, unequipping entirely is not]\n-the post-island audio track has tons of unmastered pops & clicks; this can potentially damage your speakers\n-certain Horse Mechanics [Trample-murdering a man standing 20ft away, eating shit & dying on a 2ft. fall, trample-murdering civilians while in auto-pilot/cinematic mode, etc.]\n-Clothing reverts at random, even after saving your outfit\n-Starting a mission removes your ability to set up camp, sleep, shave, change clothes, etc. \n-Being bald will prevent you from advancing in the main storyline. [Again, clear & obvious lack of game testing]\n-General Realism failures; My horse used a sandwich board as a stunt ramp to catapult me into a ceiling and fail a mission instead of just knocking the sandwich board over. A hat will save enemies from a neckshot, law officers will appear out of nowhere when no communication would be possible to dispatch them. You can find belt buckles, but can\u2019t equip them or change them. You have space for canned vegetables, but no more space for platinum rings? A hot air balloon didn\u2019t take damage from any of the countless bullets being fired??", "timestamp_created": 1734796989, "timestamp_updated": 1734797091, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183230037": {"recommendationid": "183230037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223691029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1734731455}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine not letting players play offline OR even simply just signing into a different rockstar account to play the damn game.

It's true that it starts off slow, but once you get into it and look around in the plot, it suddenly has an immersive atmosphere, and it's hard not to keep going. Personally, as someone who played the original back during the Xbox 360 era, I wasn't a huge fan of the series. The first game didn't seem bad, but it also didn't feel like my cup of tea. However, after the second game, it's a 180-degree turn.\n\nAs Rockstar Games typically does, they raise the technical level with each of their major titles, and this one is no exception. The attention to detail, the liveliness of the environment, random events, the feature set available to the player, and the diversity and size of the map are all spectacular.\n\nI was especially surprised by how they managed to bring Arthur Morgan to life. As a player of the original game, I didn't expect the prequel to RDR1 to be told from a different perspective than John's, but the opposite is true. I ended up liking Arthur even more than John. He's a very likable character who undergoes development throughout the story and grows on you more and more.\n\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was greatly impressed by the inclusion of the RDR1 map, which offers a beautiful connection to the original game since it\u2019s a prequel, and the story tells how John left his gang. However, this original map shows me why RDR1 wasn't as successful in my eyes\u2014the map is very empty, mostly deserts and uninteresting places. In RDR2, this isn\u2019t an issue, as the map for the RDR2 story is full of vibrant environments like the mountains from the first chapter or the forests and swamps from the next part of the plot. The connection between Arthur Morgan's and John Marston's stories couldn't be better, and the game gets a perfect score from me. Arthur Morgan's story was very well-written, and it\u2019s a shame when the game ends, as it\u2019s followed by the epilogue with John, and we no longer get to play as Arthur :(", "timestamp_created": 1734456952, "timestamp_updated": 1734467324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182947747": {"recommendationid": "182947747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009895045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 3271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3245, "playtime_at_review": 3271, "last_played": 1734978352}, "language": "english", "review": "I've thought a lot about this, and while there's a lot to enjoy here, the ultimate reason for the down vote is that the glitches and frustrations that exist in the game shouldn't exist in a AAA title. I ultimately uninstalled the game uncompleted, though perhaps one day I will pick it up again.\n\nI think this game, especially on sale, will give you some decent open world enjoyment. The story, when it finally gets going, is superbly told - good voice acting, great cinematics, awesome tone - but there's a lot of downtime between the momentum. You can fill this down time with some great stuff - fishing, hunting, bounty collecting, robbing - but eventually those will all get boring. Or maybe they won't for you, but for me, none of that really got me excited after the first few times. So the game's story is told in waves - high highs and low lows of energy.\n\nThe map is fantastic. The locations feel dynamic and things do feel like they're happening around you.\n\nAnd there is a lot of content. At the time of this review, I am apparently only 50% through the story. But let me be clear - the majority of my hours were not story but basic maintenance (making money) doing things that, while fun at first, quickly began to feel like more chores. Some of the side quests are genuinely interesting, but they are still just side quests - which means I'm not here for them. I'm here for the main story.\n\nBut the ultimate reason I down vote this title is because this is a AAA game whose audio snaps, crackles, and pops. I did find a fix, but it's not a sure fix; every now and then the audio starts cracking again.\n\nThe user interface is the worst I've seen in a game, with hotkeys buried behind hotkeys. In all fairness, there is a lot that your character can do, but it doesn't change the fact that the wheel key and the deadeye key are right next to each other so you constantly run the risk of holstering your weapon when you're just trying to aim your gun. And the keys seem random, too - once the game told me to pick up my hat with one button and then my gun with another. No idea why.\n\nThe games over-design is actually built into the UI; your possible actions always show in the bottom right hand of the screen. It's like the developers knew you'd have a hard time remembering all the commands and so built a never-ending tutorial into the game.\n\nAnd no, I don't care that the game's poor UI is probably the result of it being ported from console. They can port the game better or not at all; I'll judge the game on its merits as presented.\n\nAnd it's very annoying to walk over an item 8 million times in hopes of picking it up.\n\nBut if that wasn't enough for me to hate the game, stupid shit happens all the time. The boxing mechanic randomly quits, so you'll sit there and take hit after hit without being able to punch back because, for whatever reason, the key doesn't work. And once a guy started jabbering at me on the street. I tried to defuse the situation - a command you can press in the game - but I couldn't because the button grays out when someone is talking or when you're getting off your horse. By the time the guy shut up long enough for me to press the relevant button, he'd decided to pull out a knife and throw down with me. I didn't pull a gun out, but the cops still came and shot me. 10/10 for realism, maybe, but 0/10 for good gameplay.\n\nGame crashes on achievements sometimes - no idea why.\n\nThere are other things, too. And so while the story of Arthur Morgan is pretty good, it's a story that not only crawls at a snail's pace but takes frequent breaks, too.

I'll probably keep playing. Because I paid 27 euros for it. Edit: I've kept playing and it hasn't gotten better. At the moment I'm more or less just hateplaying it to kill time.\n\nDo I enjoy it? Is it a fun game or is it a dour slog filled to the brim with hammy acting and seemingly endless \"walk/ride with me for 20 minutes while I deliver some pointless exposition\" in a huge but essentially empty map? Take a wild guess.\n\nWarning, all unsaved progress will be lost if you want to quit to desktop! So how do I know if my game is saved? Fuck you, you don't. \n\nOK, so I'll save manually just to be safe. Fuck you, are you crazy?? You think we're a game with a well thought out design? Have you seen our key mapping?\n\nSpeaking of, I'd like to remap a key tied to a specific action. Fuck you, that key is also bound to 14 other actions.\n\nCentering the item storage management system on the saddle of the main horse seems like a particularly poor choice when that horse apparently stumbles on a straw of grass, tumbles over and fucking dies, leaving all your stuff stranded in the middle of nowhere. Fuck you, and start walking. \n\nI'll just set up camp at a random spot out in the wilderness, fast travel back to main camp and get another horse. Fuck you, there's an activity nearby. \n\nWhat activity? Fuck you, that's what. \n\nOK, I'll just start walking then. Fuck you, here's a zillion bounty hunters for your troubles. Now die.\n\nBy the way, why is there a 54 second unskippable cinematic with cheesy imagery and even cheesier music playing [i]every time[/i] I want to \"fast\" travel, thus negating the purpose as well as its name? Fuck you, that's why. \n\nAnd why do I have to spend 10-15 seconds looking at a pointless animation [i]every time[/i] I skin an animal or cook something? Fuck you, we work in an industry apparently staffed entirely by failed wannabe filmmakers. If we're not allowed to make proper movies we can at least force you to watch our animations by spraying them all over our alleged game. How else are we going to inflate time played by literal hours?\n\nWhy do I have to go to the saddle and retrieve my weapons [i]every time[/i] I get off a horse? Fuck you, we're all about [i]realism[/i] and [i]immersion[/i] man! \n\nSo why is there magic vision and slow motion if you have realism and immersion as cornerstones? Fuck you, that's why.\n\nAt the moment I'm carrying two Colt Single Action Army revolvers with 400 rounds, one Spencer Model 1865 Carbine repeater with 400 rounds, and a Winchester Model 1890 varmint rifle with 300 rounds, which adds up to 25 kilo in weight. And that's not counting all the stuff in my satchel which must weigh at least as much. It seems like your [i]realism[/i] and [i]immersion[/i] excuse is quite poor. Fuck you, nerd!\n\nWhy do I have to press the shoot button after [i]every time[/i] I have fired off a round to get the next one into the chamber? Fuck you and keep pushing, button monkey.\n\nWhat do the camp upgrades actually do before I spend my hard earned cash on them? Fuck you, that's what. Give me your money (the perfect metaphor for Rockstar if ever there was one).\n\nIt's amazing how they seemingly go out of their way to make the gameplay as cumbersome as possible. \n\nEdit: I had to turn off the comments thanks to some pathetic little fanboy crying about me not liking his favorite game.

However, the amount of bullshit thrown at you for the prior mentioned achievements is an utter piss-take. I'm not having a great time when I\u2019m forced to close and load into the game 20-30 times just to document a single animal out of the 200-something.
