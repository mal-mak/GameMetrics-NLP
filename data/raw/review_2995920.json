The fact that only one person needs to own this for two people to play it is brilliant, and it can be played both online and locally if you have a controller. I honestly wish more game companies did something like this.\r\n\r\nI have played both A Way Out and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, both previous projects of Josef Fares, both of those also excellent in their own right, so I had an idea of what I was getting into with It Takes Two, but it still managed to surpass my expectations. The sheer creativity and imagination on display in this game is breathtaking to say the least. There are so many things to do, not just in terms of the main game, but also a cavalcade of mini-games to play as well, including a tower climbing puzzle and a FULL set of chess!\r\n\r\nThe game takes you across many different parts of a small countryside house, including the shed, the attic, and the garden, and it presents you with a variety of different gameplay elements that keep surprising you at every turn, ensuring that the game never gets boring. It's also one of the game's best strengths that every new gameplay element is easy to understand from the introduction, and they all require teamwork between the two players in interesting and novel ways.\r\n\r\nBoth players can see everything from both players' perspective, as the game is divided down the middle like a split-screen game, which allows it to be played locally AND online, and it also allows people to communicate about things only they can see by referring to their own screen, which is nice. It can be a bit confusing for audiences, though, in case you want to stream this to friends, or want to play it on a TV with people in the room.\r\n\r\nThe game takes about 10-11 hours to complete, more if you want to be a completionist, and not one single one of them is wasted. The cutscenes are well acted, the set pieces are beautiful, the music is great, especially during the sequences that focus on sound (I'm keeping it vague as to not spoil), and the story is well written and really tucks on your heartstrings. The pair of parents you play as feel believable in their marital struggles, and the therapist book that follows you around and forces you through various couples-therapy exercises is hilarious in his own eccentric way. He's grating at first, but he grows on you over time.\r\n\r\nAn absolute recommendation from me, no doubt about it.", "timestamp_created": 1734818860, "timestamp_updated": 1734818860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183312440": {"recommendationid": "183312440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025216564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 817, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1734747803}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow wOw WOW.
