Better to give the game a pass.\r\n\r\nLong form:\r\n\r\nDon't let the hours Steam shows I've played fool you, I have another thousand or so on the stand-alone before it came to Steam. I have had lots of fun in the game, and I've been incredibly upset at the game, but if you'd asked me a couple years ago if I recommend it, I'd say yes. Unfortunately, that was during a period of rose-tinted view, and by now I have to say that the only reason I play at all is because the lower tiers are still occasionally fun, and it's become something like an addiction. \r\n\r\nAfter you leave around 5.0 to 6.0, the gameplay becomes significantly less fun. The XP requirements to progress becomes more and more substantial, the Silver Lions requirements to play for longer stretches gets more and more significant. I've spread my gameplay out across almost every country currently in the game, and the onset of the unpleasant grind kills my enjoyment of the game. As of right now, I have two countries situated at around 8.0-9.0, and they've been there for around two-hundred, maybe three-hundred hours now. The experience at this particular tier is not fun, though I'll admit a fair bit of that is my own skill level.\r\n\r\nIt is, in as few words as possible, a slog, and it just... Does not feel rewarding to progress, because I'm hyper aware that there's only more of the same no matter what I research next. I'm sure anyone who's played before that's reading this will just toss a 'skill issue' or something, and they're entitled, but nobody I've spoken to seems to have fun in these tiers. I'm told that it's more fun again once you hit max tier at 10-12, but a gap space of 5-7 entire battle ratings of headache and frustration is a huge ask, with the game depending on the idea of sunk cost to keep people around.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's MUCH less of a grind if you pay for premium accounts and premium vehicles, but I've played this whole time and only spent around 120 dollars? Or something like it. The vast majority of my experience in this game is without premium, and again, it is a slog. \r\n\r\nWith all my many hours in-game, I want to be able to say it's a good game, and I *want* to be able to recommend it to new players, but holy crap, I just can't. If the day comes that this painful suffering in this tier actually ends and it's fun to play again, I'll come back to edit this review, but until then, new players, save yourselves and your wallets the suffering. If you pay regularly, it might be more fun, but it's not worth that regular investment. If you don't pay regularly, you're going to run facefirst into a brick wall of frustration at some point between 6.0 and 10.0, and either you'll do what I've done and will keep doing and keep punching at it to get through, or you'll drop the game.

The US tech tree is littered with inaccuracies EG the HSTVL. WT modeled the tank and ammo to their liking and not to historically accurate documentation. all that to say, they killed the fire rate to 1 round every 1.4 seconds. The manufacturer spec'd that system to 2 rounds per second. they also have the ammo made of tungsten when in fact its spent uranium (huge difference in penetration statistics). Gaijin acknowledges this and decided against using its real life specs. this is one tank of oh so many. why would they do that, balance? yet the Russian tech-tree seems to have god mode (my bad, volumetric) as plot armor. another example, the M901, is at a higher BR than the marder, and bmp series which are objectively better in every regard, but placed lower to make it easier use. \n\nthere are so many more examples, (dont get me started on how much france is screwed over) but i loved this game, but the developer cant even hide their bias for russian vehicles. its the whole reason idiots were dropping classified documents about vehicles, Gaijin is totally biased. you can supply (and a great YTber named Spookston has on several occasions) non classified documentation from the US Army and the tanks manufacturer and Gaijin will give you the same standard answer... \"we researched it\" funny how their \"research\" is at complete odds with the people who designed and built the thing. \n\nmy only advise if you decide to invest any amount of time in this game, play russia. you'll still get screwed by Gaijin, but at least you wont be getting nerfed cause the developer hates the country you play.\n\nNow a moment od silence for France and its never ending uphill battle in WT", "timestamp_created": 1734288302, "timestamp_updated": 1734288302, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182792285": {"recommendationid": "182792285", "author": {"steamid": "76561199631291938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "playtime_at_review": 1904, "last_played": 1734308044}, "language": "english", "review": "I love ww2 planes, but when Im forced to spawn in and wait 20 minutes to climb straight up and then immediately get shot down by an aircraft thats 2000 times better than mine makes me want to kill myself.

Various vehicles cost $$$ to get, and they are consistently far superior to their non-paid peers. It isn't cheap pay-to-win either, with a single vehicle costing $40-$80.\n\n- The game is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes you will one-shot others or be one-shot, sometimes a dozen times to no real effect. The game is either horribly balanced, or stricken with hackers. Likely a little bit of both.\n\n- The game is a horrific time waster. If you enjoy spending 5 minutes flying a plane into battle, just to immediately be one-shot and now you're out of the match, then this is the game for you. If not, you really ought to go elsewhere.\n\n- The game looks very nice. At high settings, the graphics are quite pretty, and the game is fun to look at it as you play; if you're into sims like this.\n\n- The game has respectable physics. It's not a high-end sim quality, but it's better than average.\n\nOverall, after spending over 500 hours playing this game across various modes and a multitude of vehicles, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. The game is frustrating more often than it's fun, and some people have the inexplicable luck of being able to one-shot you in any mode, in any vehicle, at any time.

The game seems fine at first, allowing you to pretty much endlessly queue for game after game with the starter tanks. But the problem happens when you increase the ranks of the vehicles. You have a currency called SL (Silver Lions) that you earn through playing. The repair cost of a tank is paid in SL. But the higher the rank of vehicle, the more SL it takes to fix. This leads to you having to suffer a loss each game you play, unless you shoot enough people or don't damage your vehicle. Otherwise you can just wait hours for it to repair itself. This turns the game from being fun, to being like those mobile games where you only get so many plays per day and have to wait a long time to regain them.\nOverall, it's fun.

They don't listen to the creators, let alone players. Moderators such as TrickZZter make life even more hell.\nGaijin's only defenders are the Russains who main comparatively cheaper vehicles (game currency-wise) and are some are grossly overtuned.

There is just enough time between matches for your blood pressure to calm down and stop your veins from bursting. Everyone has a magic dart that can pen you no matter the angle or armor thickness. If you are in a heavy tank you are going to face the only tank in the enemy team that can one shot and pen your strongest angled armor. Higher tiers is just snap shot fest who can shoot the fastest and most shots are one shots. you need to know the maps and know every camping spot to survive the top tier. \n\nProgression and economy is so slow that it can take years to research just one country's tech tree and even with premium account and vehicle it only reduces the time needed to half. Premium vehicles are just a trap to new players thinking it is going help them get more kills and points but the game might in the worst case become even harder if you jump to higher tier where the game play and tactics are completely different where you are used to.\n\nI enjoy playing heavy tanks and would like Gajin to make the armor mean something again. Keep WW2 and cold war vehicles separated. Heavy tanks should be scary, slow, killing machines almost like mini bosses that are unkillable from the front. remove the dart rounds and every magic bullet from low tiers that can pen everything.\n\nvehicles are not balanced for such a big BR range to be fun. Armor or cannons are not good enough in every case to be enough to compete with enemies. Reduce the BR scale from +/-1 to like 0.4. yes the queue times are going to increase but i would rather wait 20 seconds more for a game im going to enjoy than get a instant game where im up tiered to a game where my tank is mostly just a useless spectator where i can maybe shoot enemies barrels or tracks off. Yes there is always something you can do in a match no matter how unlucky you are in the matchmaker but no i dont want to be forced to be a scout in my tank. Atleast add a big boost to research and income for your actions in a up tier to incentivize people to try to do stuff in the match. \n\nThe game can be fun at times but most often you just die to some random shell flying across the map between trees and windows that sends you back to hangar. oh and i forgot to mention close air support. there is not much you can do against them if your team don't have planes to counter them. most AA vehicles overheat so fast that you cant kill the planes or they are just so weak BB guns that they cant even scratch the windshield on the planes and yes its mostly just a skill issue.\n\n If you start you should start with Russian tree because there is strong bias for those vehicles.", "timestamp_created": 1734820566, "timestamp_updated": 1734820566, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502155184745788574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182920417": {"recommendationid": "182920417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416342853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 6772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2853, "playtime_at_review": 6094, "last_played": 1735058205}, "language": "english", "review": "god i hope the guys making gunner heat pc get to complete their game cause man there's nothing like this yet its a chore to play\n\nim too far in to give up", "timestamp_created": 1734389558, "timestamp_updated": 1734876788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500640213489532471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182919106": {"recommendationid": "182919106", "author": {"steamid": "76561199511353325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1256, "playtime_at_review": 3954, "last_played": 1734814069}, "language": "english", "review": "Forced me to get a Gaijin account and then promptly deleted all of my progress.
