It\u2019s chaotic, it\u2019s hilarious, and honestly, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing but I\u2019m having a blast doing it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1735049904, "timestamp_updated": 1735049904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183569339": {"recommendationid": "183569339", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060117620", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1126, "playtime_at_review": 1080, "last_played": 1735054903}, "language": "english", "review": "skibidi", "timestamp_created": 1735049815, "timestamp_updated": 1735049815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183569305": {"recommendationid": "183569305", "author": {"steamid": "76561199590208087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 831, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1735057026}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1735049787, "timestamp_updated": 1735049787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183569291": {"recommendationid": "183569291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199453964250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1766, "playtime_at_review": 2048, "last_played": 1735056073}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate this game so buggy crashes everytime i load up the groot skin please if you want to save your soul do not play this game", "timestamp_created": 1735049772, "timestamp_updated": 1735049772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183569279": {"recommendationid": "183569279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377496222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2898, "playtime_at_review": 4502, "last_played": 1735058221}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazin", "timestamp_created": 1735049762, "timestamp_updated": 1735049762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183568824": {"recommendationid": "183568824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393696641", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1940, "playtime_at_review": 1911, "last_played": 1735056577}, "language": "english", "review": "OW but better", "timestamp_created": 1735049392, "timestamp_updated": 1735049392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183568612": {"recommendationid": "183568612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395906241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1894, "playtime_at_review": 1894, "last_played": 1735049012}, "language": "english", "review": "Was fun at the beginning but after the christmas update, the server (singapore) started to lag and give very high ping, making me rage.

It is at least for me.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a little slower-paced, and has just a slight layer of jank to it due to some of the destructible environments (and the shoddy sound effects), but in my opinion offers a lot of what used to make OW so fun, before it became what it is today. Especially with 6v6, team fights are fun and can last a while, instead of one team losing the moment a pick or two happens. \r\n\r\nThe heroes are really diverse and fun, and the supports are actually all pretty fun to play (except Adam Warlock, I don't get him). A lot of the abilities are really cool, and the ults are mostly fun to use and I feel like fit the heroes well. Tbh tho the game needs more tanks and supports. There are tons of dmg heroes, and many of them are very fun to play, but there are only a handful of tanks, some of which just aren't that fun. \r\n\r\nIt's clear there is a pick-counterpick aspect like there is with OW, though I don't think it's always so obvious who would be well-suited to counterpick some heroes. But it is clear that hero-swapping is a core mechanic of the game, and should be used liberally when dying frequently in a match. Stubbornly continuing with a team comp that just isn't working is the downfall of many teams in this game. I like that this game makes recommendations on what hero picks it thinks you should make, and doesn't really seem to enforce any kind of \"2-2-2\" comp or anything, which is refreshing (I found the game recommending duelist when there was only a single tank).\r\n\r\nI do think the cosmetics are CRAZY over-priced, and the progression on the battlepass is a bit slow, and the multi-currency thing is just annoying. I can overlook that stuff however, because the game is free, and I haven't felt compelled to spend any amount of money on buying currency, except to buy the season 0 battlepass. I'll probably continue to buy the battlepasses going forward, but don't plan to spend any additional money on skins. They're just too expensive.\r\n\r\nBut if you can look past that and just focus on the gameplay, this game is worth your time. It's a lot of fun, and I imagine I'll probably sink a ton of hours into it like I did with OW. Plus there's basically a limitless pool of awesome heroes for them to pull from for future updates, so I feel like this one will be around for a while.

The decision to make this a third-person game is genius\u2014while I usually prefer first-person, the perspective fits perfectly here. It allows for more dynamic combat and situational awareness, and honestly, first-person would\u2019ve taken away from the experience.\n\nOne of the standout features is the destructible environments. Whether you\u2019re creating new pathways, sneaking around holes in walls, or taking down entire buildings, the destruction adds so much to the strategy and fun of the game. It feels chaotic in the best way, making every battle feel alive.\n\nWhat really sets Marvel Rivals apart is how much respect the developers have for each character. I\u2019ll admit, I had my doubts going in, but it\u2019s clear this game was made by true Marvel fans. Swinging and zipping through the map as Spider-Man genuinely makes you feel like the web-slinger, while soaring as Iron Man and blasting enemies with repulsors or his Unibeam is just as thrilling. Each character plays exactly how you\u2019d expect, staying faithful to their abilities and personality, which makes the gameplay even more immersive.\n\nOn top of that, the addition of team-up abilities is just genius. Coordinating with your team or friends to unleash combined powers brings a whole new level of excitement. It\u2019s not just about individual skill\u2014it\u2019s about teamwork and strategy, which makes every match feel like an epic Marvel moment.\n\nAnother cool feature is the seasonal buffs for different characters. It keeps things fresh and adds a layer of strategy to picking your roster. The fact that the developers clearly communicate which characters are buffed is a big plus in my book\u2014it shows they care about keeping the game balanced and engaging.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Marvel Rivals absolutely nails it. The game worked perfectly on day one, which is almost unheard of these days. There are no queue times when searching for a match\u2014none. You click \u201cFind Match,\u201d and poof, you\u2019re in. It\u2019s a level of speed and efficiency I\u2019ve rarely seen in online games. The matchmaking system also lets you choose which servers to search for matches in, showing your ping for each one. Plus, it displays connection bars for everyone in your party, so you can easily find the best server for your team. These thoughtful details make for an incredibly smooth experience.\n\nThe characters are mostly overpowered, which is incredibly fun, though some could use a few nerfs or buffs to balance things out. But the low time-to-kill (TTK) is a refreshing change compared to games like Overwatch. It makes the combat feel fast, intense, and incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe battle pass system deserves special mention. Once you buy a pass, it\u2019s yours forever\u2014there\u2019s no time limit to grind through it, which is exactly how battle passes should be done. It\u2019s a player-friendly system that respects your time and investment, and I wish more games would adopt it.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. The art style captures the Marvel universe beautifully while still feeling unique. Every character design I\u2019ve seen is amazing, and the skins they\u2019ve released are fantastic. Yes, they\u2019re a little overpriced, but since the game is free-to-play, it\u2019s understandable that this is how they fund ongoing development.\n\nOverall, Marvel Rivals has become my new go-to competitive game. With its destructible environments, true-to-character gameplay, team-up abilities, smooth launch, instant matchmaking, and thoughtful systems like the battle pass, it feels like a love letter to Marvel fans.

a Nerf\r\n\r\nMarvel Rivals is undeniably fun, with engaging gameplay and plenty of action-packed moments. However, there's one glaring issue that dampens the experience: Hawkeye.\r\n\r\nThe character is completely overpowered. Every arrow feels like a guaranteed headshot, no matter where it lands. Miss high? Headshot. Hit the body? Headshot. Shoot two feet below me while I\u2019m airborne? Somehow still a headshot. It\u2019s absurd.\r\n\r\nEvery lobby is dominated by players picking Hawkeye, making matches feel more like a survival challenge against his broken mechanics than a balanced competition. It\u2019s frustrating to the point that I\u2019ve decided to step away from the game until the developers address this issue.\r\n\r\nMarvel Rivals has a ton of potential, but for now, it\u2019s tough to enjoy when one character throws the entire balance off. Here\u2019s hoping for a patch soon, because this could be a truly great game.", "timestamp_created": 1735023849, "timestamp_updated": 1735023849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Even the most unbalanced heroes, whether they feel a little too strong or slightly underpowered, just need a small nudge in the right direction. Nothing feels outright broken, which is impressive for a game of this scale right out of the gate. The gameplay is fast, fun, and incredibly polished for such a new release.\n\nThe Winter Celebration event adds a lot to enjoy, with fresh missions and festive content that make the game feel alive during the season. It\u2019s a fun addition that rewards players without feeling grindy or overwhelming.\n\nWhat really sets Marvel Rivals apart is how respectful it is to its players. The battle pass is extremely fair. You can keep progressing it even after the season ends, which takes away the pressure to grind or rush. Microtransactions are purely cosmetic, so nothing feels pay-to-win, and the focus stays on having fun.\n\nMarvel Rivals is exactly what the hero shooter genre needed.

I stomped a few lobbies and found myself losing games where I went 46-5, so it at least feels like it is doing the classic thing these games do where they try and hamfist \"fair\" matches. \n\nHonestly, it's really nothing special. If it wasn't an established IP I doubt it would be doing numbers. I'm a certified Marvel hater, so I can't see myself actually playing this for the game itself. \n\nwholesome reddit chungus marvel funko pop soyjak point squirrel girl real 2024???", "timestamp_created": 1735014004, "timestamp_updated": 1735014004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183537059": {"recommendationid": "183537059", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216389554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1240, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1735019456}, "language": "english", "review": "i", "timestamp_created": 1735013944, "timestamp_updated": 1735013944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183537041": {"recommendationid": "183537041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199624862888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3819, "playtime_at_review": 3878, "last_played": 1735018823}, "language": "english", "review": "I'M ADDICTED", "timestamp_created": 1735013929, "timestamp_updated": 1735013929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183536952": {"recommendationid": "183536952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078066089", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2664, "playtime_at_review": 3151, "last_played": 1735057736}, "language": "english", "review": "To keep it short, this game is everything I've ever loved about Overwatch back in the peak (2016-2018) days of that game.

I'm not sure what they can do, but I hope they look into it.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, they did add a new mode for the holiday, which is awesome, and I hope they keep trying new things. They\u2019re also doing a good job with handling cheaters and rule breakers, even though there are still plenty out there.\r\n\r\nOverall, Marvel Rivals is a blast, with just a few things that need tweaking to make it even better.", "timestamp_created": 1735012056, "timestamp_updated": 1735012056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183535459": {"recommendationid": "183535459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096424768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1820, "playtime_at_review": 1829, "last_played": 1735017584}, "language": "english", "review": "chad overwatch", "timestamp_created": 1735012050, "timestamp_updated": 1735012050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183535439": {"recommendationid": "183535439", "author": {"steamid": "76561199515767982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 907, "playtime_at_review": 1302, "last_played": 1734999515}, "language": "english", "review": ":3", "timestamp_created": 1735012028, "timestamp_updated": 1735012028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183535425": {"recommendationid": "183535425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098402504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 218, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1734931013}, "language": "english", "review": "sure guy", "timestamp_created": 1735012006, "timestamp_updated": 1735012006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183535357": {"recommendationid": "183535357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377836633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 300, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1735014834}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game fine a week ago and no issues in any other game i get disconnected every single second and canjt even play a full game it is ridiculous to release a game like this and just constantly have this issue", "timestamp_created": 1735011924, "timestamp_updated": 1735011924, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183535290": {"recommendationid": "183535290", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082404224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 650, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1735016699}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a special game.

OW2 has been a real sad place lately. They are starting to experiment with 6v6 again, but at this point, my love for that game has already left.\n\nIn comes Marvel Rivals. It's appealing for the obvious reasons: i'm a fan of the heroes, the art style is cool, gameplay is fun. But what I love about this game, and what I think makes it stand out from other hero shooters, is in the philosophy I am seeing so far in terms of team composition, hero balance, and overall gameplay feel. \n\nI get the sense that the developers of this game are more concerned with the \"hero fantasy\" and \"rule of cool\" rather than trying to formulate a perfectly competitively balanced hero roster like Overwatch 2 has been trying to achieve. I love that people can't yet agree on whether Hulk is trash or busted, same with Scarlet Witch, or Namor, or Iron Man, or Wolverine, etc. Obviously we are still VERY early in the game's life, but from what I can see, you can pop off with just about anyone. And a big part of what enables certain characters to pop off lies in my favorite thing about Marvel Rivals: the team-ups.\n\nCurrently, there aren't very many team-ups, and they vary quite a bit in terms of how impactful they actually are. Rocket Raccoon's teamup with Bucky and Punisher, for example, is MUCH more powerful than how Rocket or Jeff can ride Groot's shoulders, which is way more cool/cute than it is actually functional or competitively viable. But, the prospect of what these team-ups can mean for the future of the game... It elevates the possibilities to a whole other level. People have been arguing about this game needing a role lock system, but down the line, if there are a bunch of team-ups that can make an otherwise funky composition work, then that is so much more exciting than \"we both have 2-2-2 every game because it's easier to balance\". Again, the rule of cool takes precedent here, and I LOVE that. It is so much more fun and makes me really exciting for the possibilities in future team-ups... like what if they introduced bigger team-ups for having 4+ Avengers with bonuses for different roles, or all members of the Fantastic 4 get some big combo, same with X-men, etc. The possibilities are endless and that's super exciting.\n\nOverall, I'm having a VERY good time with this game. I would consider myself a casually competitive gamer... I don't need to grind ranked and have the highest number to have fun, but I definitely have the most fun learning the mechanics, improving on a variety of heroes/roles, and popping TF off. This game fits my preferred experience perfectly. I definitely recommend trying it out and giving it a couple hours to see if you enjoy how it flows.", "timestamp_created": 1734990455, "timestamp_updated": 1734990455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183515053": {"recommendationid": "183515053", "author": {"steamid": "76561199252753214", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 825, "playtime_at_review": 1163, "last_played": 1734898359}, "language": "english", "review": "BRTTTTTTT", "timestamp_created": 1734990445, "timestamp_updated": 1734990445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183515048": {"recommendationid": "183515048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244477034", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 876, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1734989574}, "language": "english", "review": "This third-person shooter delivers a perfect mix of fast-paced action, strategic gameplay, and a roster of iconic characters that Marvel fans will love. The inclusion of fun and quirky additions like Jeff the Shark adds a layer of humor and charm that sets the game apart.\n\nCompared to Overwatch 2, \"Marvel Rivals\" feels more engaging and innovative. The character designs are not only visually stunning but also distinct in their playstyles, making every match feel unique and exciting. Whether you\u2019re zipping through the map as a high-flying hero or causing chaos as a heavy-hitting brawler, there's something for everyone.\n\nOne of the standout features of *Marvel Rivals* is its impressive environmental destructibility. It strikes a perfect balance\u2014not overwhelming the gameplay but adding just enough to keep every match dynamic and immersive. Buildings crumble, cover gets shredded, and debris realistically reacts to the chaos unfolding around you. The destruction feels purposeful and polished, enhancing the strategic depth without becoming a gimmick. It\u2019s a testament to the developers\u2019 attention to detail and commitment to delivering a high-quality experience.\n\nMy gameplay favorites are Moon Knight, Hawkeye, Luna Snow, and Psylocke.

The balance is off, the abilities aren't there for some character (Magneto is nothing what he should be) and some characters are just straight up busted/OP. Sadly, like all \"live service\" games, we are the beta testers and there's a lot to test.\n\nI wish Steam could give us refunds for battle passes. This one is one of the worst I have ever seen. All skins no one will give a F about. It's also super short compared to Fortnite or any other live service game. Has ZERO skins anyone actually wants (MCU, etc). Total trash tier skins.\n\nOverall It has promise for sure and is clearly better than OW2, so I hope to change this to a recommended in the near future.

Some may feel a bit OP at the moment but that's alright, playing against OP characters and coming up with strategies to defeat them is what makes the game fun. Besides, it all comes down to team play, if you have a bad team, its gg anyway. And since they are from Marvel universe there's already some interesting lore. What I liked about this game is that you can access everything(comics and lore stuff) in game, instead of having to go through opening up your browser and getting redirected to some other website which can at times become annoying. \r\n\r\nNow the bad parts. Since this runs on UE5, it is NOT optimized for low-end hardware. I've seen various threads on sites where people can't run this game on integrated graphics and some even mentioned facing crashes on high-end hardware. As this is purely a Online PvP game, this might hurt the game's user-base down the line. Devs will need to work on the optimizations more.\r\n\r\nAnd there's waaaaay toooo many different currencies, which ultimately becomes very confusing. Should I use \"chrono whatever\" or the blue coins to buy a skin? What's up with the gold ones? Just keep it between 1 or 2 to make things easier to understand.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a much better alternative to overwatch.

never helps. *cough cough* role based match making could fix that slightly but the devs think its a sin to add. not to mention game runs poorly. in order to get it to run well, i have to lower settings, and that ok except the ui gets blurry and actually unreadable? how, how do you mess that up?. healing is to fast and makes flanking/punishing feel like a chore as the enemy healer will full heal them within a second. also, there is almost no visual indicator that the player is low health, like a red screen when low health, so some times it feels as if you can pick a fight but your 1 shot and dont realize it. game has like 30 heros to play, but some feel bland and without a proper kit, like jeff or black widow, then other heros will have like 6 abilities making them feel like a must pick. game just feels scrapped together at times. also honestly, marvel feels so over saturated and im getting tired of it in general. welp, hero shooter number 1463 is not fun, who would have

Marvel Rivals doesn't exactly do anything new within the genre but yet it feels unique and has potential considering the Marvel IP they have with a huge variety of characters to choose from.\r\n\r\nWhile I am enjoying the game, I won't be glazing Marvel Rivals or downplaying Overwatch in this \"review\". I'm just here to talk about some concerns that I have regarding the future of the game.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h3]Optimization[/h3]\r\nIt's running Unreal Engine 5 so it's no surprise that there's performance issues with the game especially on lower-end hardware but considering it's a game with a competitive mode, I feel optimization should be a priority for the game. A lot of the negative reviews on the game, at least on Steam, are talking about constant crashes, stuttering, low performance, graphics cards running out of video memory.\r\n\r\n[h3]Visual Cues[/h3]\r\nWhen you get hit in any game, there's almost always a \"hit indicator\" showing the direction of the damage and where it's coming from. These hit indicators in the game feel a bit off, sometimes it tells you the correct direction and other times it shows a completely different direction even though you can see where the enemies' hits are coming from.\r\n\r\nYou can test this within the practice range, at more than 5m range it tells you the correct direction - you get hit by in front of you, it'll show the correct hit indicator above the crosshair to indicate it's coming from in front of you and if you move your camera around, the hit indicator will rotate around your crosshair correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you go into melee range even if you get hit directly in front of you, the hit indicator will be shown on the bottom left of  your crosshair and when you move around your crosshair or model it'll still show an incorrect hit indicator. You could argue that the hit indicator is based on the center of your character's model but you can just play around in the practice range, move your character and camera around to see that it's a little inconsistent. It's a little hard to explain in text considering it's a visual cue so it's more of a \"seeing\" thing but I feel the hit indicator should register based on your camera angle rather than your character model (if that is actually the case).\r\n\r\n[h3]Balancing Concerns[/h3]\r\nCurrently in Season 0, it sort of feels like \"everyone is OP therefore no one is OP\" that some games like Dota are designed around, but that's probably just people trying out different characters while it's still fresh. That said, there are some that are stronger than others, especially because of the yellow icon on the corner of the character portrait called a \"Season Boost\" where vanguards get bonus health, duelists get bonus damage and strategists get bonus healing.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I feel it is a lazy way to buff certain characters, especially long-term when players are more familiar to the game and get more sweaty. It's an artificial way to tell players \"play this character this season, we buffed them.\" There are some characters that would feel less playable without the Season Boost such as Venom or Thor who are just squishy without the bonus health that I feel they should just add the health to their base kit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some heroes that are exceptionally strong because of the Season Boost, namely duelists such as Hawkeye, Hela and Iron Fist which make them unfun to play against. Rather than relying on Season Boosts to further buff a character, just buff their base kit/numbers or around their Team-Ups. Regardless of whether the game balance will lean towards a more casual direction or a more competitive environment like Overwatch, I don't think Season Boost is a good idea.\r\n\r\n[h3]Role Issues[/h3]\r\nMarvel Rivals currently has a role issue where a majority of the players just wants to play duelist (damage/dps), and then proceeds to ask for someone else to pick a vanguard (tank) and strategist (support). One factor is that, as of launch, there are only 8 tanks and 7 supports compared to the 18 damage characters in the roster of 33 characters so there's more characters for players to try out and find their main.\r\n\r\nAnother contributing factor is a lot of the recognizable fan favourite characters within the Marvel Universe are duelists: Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Black Panther, Wolverine. Sure, you have some fan favourites in the other roles such as Captain America, Thor, Loki, but their kits just aren't as appealing as the duelist characters.\r\n\r\nIn all fairness, in any game within any genre that has roles, people tend to lean more towards damage characters or roles more because it's just more fun seeing big damage numbers rather than protecting the team through damage blocked or healing provided numbers.\r\n\r\nThat said, speaking of the solo tank experience: In Overwatch 2's case, the solo tank role has too much responsibilities that it's just generally unfun for the average player regardless of what hero they enjoy playing. While Marvel Rivals is still relatively a new game, the solo tank experience here feels so much better than in Overwatch 2. In its current state, there's no counter-picking, no anti-healing, no excessive crowd control, which are the three main issues of the solo tank experience in Overwatch 2.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, solo supporting in Marvel Rivals is just unfun. Yes, there are some characters that can output healing as much as two supports like Jeff, Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow (and maybe some other characters too if you try hard enough) but the unfun part comes when you get enemies that have at least two characters that dive you while your team of five duelists blame you for the lack of healing as they refuse to swap off even if they're going 0-10-0.\r\n\r\nOf course, all these issues can be reduced by \"just\" playing in a party but that doesn't fix the issues - it's just putting a bandaid over a big problem. I personally don't think role queue is the solution to this, as I feel that would reduce the game's uniqueness since it'd basically be following Overwatch's route and possibly increase queue times. However, I think there should be some form of role restrictions, perhaps a \"minimum 1 per role\" or \"maximum 3 per role\" sort of thing.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\nHero shooter is one of my favourite game genres and it's nice to see a return to the genre especially after Overwatch 2's lack of exciting seasonal updates and \"monopoly\" over the genre, Paladins' lack of polish, Team Fortress 2's lack of update since Jungle Inferno back in 2017. As someone who started playing Team Fortress 2 back in 2010, enjoyed Gotham City Impostors, Gigantic, Monday Night Combat while they were popular, Marvel Rivals is a nice addition to the genre and definitely a much needed competition for Overwatch 2 in order for both and even upcoming games to try and compete with each other.", "timestamp_created": 1733922962, "timestamp_updated": 1733922962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 376, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884374141693115234", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182004366": {"recommendationid": "182004366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098430092", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 633, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1735059326}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun so far.

I wasn't really sure if I would have fun. I wasn't really sure if I was going to be forced to \"be the best\" at what \"role\" you choose, like Overwatch (2). I gave it a go last night and let me tell you... I had an absolute blast playing it! \n\nBefore I get into it a quick disclaimer!\n\n[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] \n\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \n\u26abThe game's battlepass never expires. This should be \"industry standard\" for the more casual player, or at least let us swap between battlepass's when they come out.\n\u26abTHERE IS NO FOMO!!!\n\u26abThe price of bundles/monetisation is extremely well balanced. You are not charged an extortionate amount of money for an \"ultimate\" skin. Think Overwatch 2's mythic skins which are pure greed.\n\u26abYou can get the \"premium\" currency via a 1-1 conversion rate. So if you earn the FREE currency, say you have 100 of it. You can convert all of this into PAID currency on a 1-1 ratio.\n\u26abALL heroes are unlocked from the very start of the game. Yes, that's correct. All 35 are unlocked. Unlike Overwatch 2.\n\u26abThe amount of different combat \"approaches\" you can have while playing this game is insane. Like, you can play Iron man and rain death from above. You can play Thor and devastate your enemies with an array of melee attacks. To playing spider-man, swinging around doing his \"AMAZING\" combo. So much potential here!!\n\u26abEach \"tank\", \"healer\", \"dps\" e.t.c offer a unique different playstyle which you can tailor to how you play and find one you like.\n\u26abThe Art style of the game is also pretty damn good and it all just... works flawlessly. There is so much chaotic mayhem happening at any given time, the transitions, the map destruction... it all just works seamlessly. Have a look at Thor, I just LOVE the way he looks: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3379535150 \n\u26abAll standard skins seem to be nice looking. No \"pack\" is advertised or SHOVED down your throat to purchase when logging in. All optional. Like, just have a look at Iron Mans skin, and read the quote: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3379535432 \n\u26abNo character is \"sexualised\" like The First Descendant or Overwatch 2 showing us that the people that ACTUALLY made this game, know who their target audience is and WHAT they are doing.\n\u26abMarvel Rivals is unbelievably well optimised. I haven't had a single issue and neither has my friends which is astounding. We all have different PC setups so the fact that none of us have issues.... wow.\n\u26abITS FREE-TO-PLAY!!! So, in the end... you're loosing nothing so why not give it a shot.\n\n[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1] \n\u26abThere are some characters that do need a little bit of a nerf/buff or some balancing. \n\u26abSometimes it's kind of hard to tell who is \"ulting\" because they all kinda sound the same.\n\nPersonally, I don't see anything else wrong with it. This is my opinion after all.\n\n[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] \nMarvel Rivals is the definition of \"GAME DEVELOPMENT DONE RIGHT\" and this should be the INDUSTRY STANDARD on paid items and battlepass's, ESPECIALLY the currency conversion (1-1) free - paid or vice versa. This is probably one of the most talked about things I have seen so far.\n\nI am really looking forward to playing more of this and I cannot wait to see who they add next or what direction this game will go in! My only hope is that they continue to add in PROPER comic related skins and characters and not charge us \u00a390 for a myhtic skin (wonder what game I'm talking about eh).\n\n[h1][b] 9/10. A Free-to-Play game done RIGHT by passionate developers that actually care about the player and game!

Almost like they don't work together they need to make the characters movement a little bit faster. \n\nOverall for a Marvel PvP i'm surprised how much they did get right. \nLets hope this game lasts, we don't want it turning into something like Multiverses or take the path Overwatch did. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1733724174, "timestamp_updated": 1733724460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687340736389160156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182439670": {"recommendationid": "182439670", "author": {"steamid": "76561199442862627", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 521, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1734364147}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019ve never watched a single Marvel movie, and here I am being dragged into the depths of this Marvel game, even though I couldn\u2019t even name more than 3 characters before\r\nBut this ain\u2019t gonna convince me to watch any Disney or Marvel movie\u2014DON\u2019T LET THIS GAME FOOL YOU", "timestamp_created": 1733858712, "timestamp_updated": 1733858712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734274327754974365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182259588": {"recommendationid": "182259588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275220325", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 818, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1734719549}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Has a long way to go [/h1]\n\nIt seems that there haven't been much improvements since the playtests. it's a decently fun game, especially when played with friends but it has a lot of issues that need ironing out. Right now, I cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n - Visual style is amazing! The characters, animations and effects are all very flashy yet cohesive. \n - Good monetisation so far\n - Interesting characters. Decent mix of mainstream and obscure characters\n - Some character abilities are pretty unique and is a fresh take compared to other Hero Shooters\n - Team up abilities are interesting both from a gameplay and lore perspective. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n - Poor optimisation. Lots of frame drops and sometimes the game just feels sluggish\n - Poor hit feedback. Most characters don't have impact sounds on hit and unless you're paying attention to enemy health bars closely, it's sometimes difficult to tell if you've actually landed a hit.\n - Poor audio mixing. Settings don't cover all parts of the game and certain parts are extremely loud when compared to others.\n - Voice lines give me secondhand embarrassment and most voice overs don't stand out.\n - Character movement is floaty and some heroes have way too many movement abilities when some of them could've been made into passives and less complex.\n - Maps are beautiful to look at but uncomfortable to traverse through. It feels like it would've suited a singleplayer game more. \n - Needs better visual indicators for some enemy abilities\n \n[b]The game is also balanced very poorly but that can be excused for now considering it only just released.[/b] \n\nSo yeah, even though I had fun, there are parts of the game I find very dissatisfying and frustrating.

designs (default skins) A LOT.\r\nmost of the payed skins ape off of the marvel and x men movies but i like the comic book inspirations a lot more, they look about as cool as the comic art as well.\r\n\r\nthe fast pace of the games is great, feels fair to lose, feels great to win.\r\nThe game is fast paced ranging from 6-10 minutes each, at least quickmatch, and i think it might have a fun E-sports scene as well, i'm certainly excited to see some games from people that dedicate their lives to the game.\r\n\r\nThe team up feature is incredible, i don't mind playing different heroes so i'm having a great time picking according to teammates picks, i can see it being really annoying for people that just wanna play their characters because team ups are just an advantage for most heroes, the hero GIVING the passive gets more damage or health, that is a huge advantage in a game with characters THIS squishy. so the meta might get a little stale unless a lot of these team ups change between seasons.\r\n\r\nnot all characters are built equal though, Hela is incredibly powerful, she really doesn't need all that health in her ult, meanwhile the melee champion Magik gets no extra health, seems a little weird to me. it takes the ENTIRE TEAM to blast Hela and her alone to kill her out of the ult while she can 2 shot healers and DPS, scarlet witch's ult can at least easily be cancelled if you focus her for second or 2.\r\n(Hela is among my favorite characters to play, i'm not salty, i genuinely think it's too strong)\r\n\r\nbesides the mild balancing issues i bought the battlepass, they've adapted a form of the helldivers 2 progression system, and i don't like it entirely.\r\nit feels a little disrespectful for a product i payed for, there's pages where you can buy items on, there's 5 tiers and you need to get those purple coins to progress the pass to the next tier, now there's a skin in the first 3 tiers however to get that skin you must purchase all the items in that tier including the skin, you will have to pick and choose and overachieve to get all items in the battlepass because opening up a tier happens before you get enough purple coins to buy all the items on that tier, it's telling me that they want my time, every day because you wanna do those daily challenges and events to get all the purple coins to get to the end.\r\ndespite the battlepass being available forever i still feel like i need to WORK to get it done, and work sucks, nobody likes work if they have a hobby.\r\n\r\nregardless, i'm still enjoying the game and will probably

Not having it is terribly unfun and is harmful for the longevity of the game.\n\nMore options for tank and healer/support (goes with previous statement): upon release there are over 33 characters to select from... but only 15 of which are either a tank or support character. 55% of the characters in the game are dps characters. The game is seeing an insane amount of people playing only dps characters probably as a result, not to mention that its almost completely unrewarding to play support at all.\n\nOptimization: I have the game set at all the lowest settings and can barely manage 55 fps while in game, sometimes seeing lows as far as 20 fps (although this is when everyone ults/spams abilities to be fair). The game at these settings aren't even that spectacular yet I can't manage to get many frames. While I don't have the greatest build, I don't have this issue with almost any other game I play, especially not on settings this low either.\n\nCertain characters need to be balanced further: \nStorm seems really cool to play, but doesn't have nearly as much mobility as she should for how much damage she does and as much health as she has. I feel like a floating target waiting to be shot at. Personally, 10~15% extra damage, and or having a higher speed boost would feel quite nice on her. Her ultimate however is ridiculous and probably needs to be nerfed. I have seen 4 Storm ults be used, and each one was either a 4 or 5 man kill. It has a huge range, and does an absurd amount of damage in a short time.\nScarlet Witch if played like a flanker is difficult to deal with. She's easily in my top 5 characters due to her fade (with free flight) and her primary fire having decent range. While she's my favorite (and best character) she clearly needs a nerf, that being either longer cooldowns between her fades or a range reduction on her primary fire. Her ultimate is very powerful but balanced IMO as you have to be somewhat close to kill, and are slow flying in the air for what feels like 2 to 3 seconds ( a long enough time to get melted if the team sees you, which has happened to me a number of times).\nPeni Parker needs balancing. I don't know what specifically (maybe a cap on the number of mines she can use) but anytime I use her, or the opposing team uses her, its GG. She's got very good CC, and decent mobility too with her web grapple. Not to mention her ability to tie people up momentarily, allowing your team to focus the binded target.\nI don't feel like writing more of a novel, so some other characters I think need a look at are Hela (can two shot characters with primary fire),, Punisher (mostly his ult), Adam Warlock (OG Mercy rez is OP), Loki (clones are too good, healing potential/survivability is too high), Mantis (charm guarantees a kill), Moon Knight (while his ankhs can be destroyed quickly,  he can very easily rack up tons of damage on anyone inside of them even for that brief moment, even allowing players to get their ultimate just in the first fight of the match).\nOther than that, I think tanks across the board need buffs (except Peni). No tank aside from Peni has had much pressure on any fight, or has created as much space in a fight as much as the dps have. It could be a lack of people's knowledge on the characters causing this issue, but I still think they feel pretty weak.", "timestamp_created": 1733581881, "timestamp_updated": 1733581881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624435782432556152", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1733810879, "developer_response": "Dear Doctor Mass,\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback in terms of role quee, hero balance and optimization.

However, \"Marvel Rivals\" is a glaring example of how misguided creative direction can lead to a product that feels more like an afterthought than a worthy addition to the genre. Unfortunately, this title seems determined to shatter any hopes fans had for an engaging multiplayer experience.\n\nFrom the get-go, \"Marvel Rivals\" presents itself as an ambitious attempt to capture the dynamics of games like \"Overwatch,\" but it falls woefully short. The promise of a strategic, hero-based shooter is drowned out by poor mechanics, uninspired gameplay, and a glaring lack of character depth. As players dive into the action, they quickly realize that the combat is clunky and unbalanced, with characters that feel like pale imitations of their comic book counterparts. Rather than a rich tapestry of heroes and villains, we are met with watered-down representations that do little justice to the legacies they are meant to embody.\n\nAdding to the frustration is the management of the properties themselves. The decision to dilute beloved characters under the stewardship of figures like James Gunn and Marvel's creative leadership feels like a betrayal to long-time fans. The creative vision, or lack thereof, behind \"Marvel Rivals\" reeks of a rushed project that prioritizes quick profits over genuine storytelling or gameplay innovation. It's as if both franchises are in a race to see who can drive their beloved universes into the ground faster.\n\nMoreover, the negative sentiment surrounding the current direction of these superhero narratives is palpable. Many fans echo the sentiment that the \"cape shit\" genre has reached its saturation point. With so many entries trying to capture the same formula, originality has taken a backseat, and unfortunately, \"Marvel Rivals\" is a testament to this decline. It makes one wonder if we are witnessing the end of an era rather than a renaissance for superhero games.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Marvel Rivals\" is a disappointing foray into a genre that once held so much promise. With lackluster gameplay, poor character portrayals, and a creative team that seems to be steering the franchise off a cliff, it is difficult to recommend this title to anyone. If this was meant to be the \"Overwatch killer,\" it missed the mark by a wide margin. Perhaps it\u2019s time to put the cape and cowl to rest and seek fresh horizons beyond the superhero realm. For fans seeking engaging gameplay, there are far better options available in the vast gaming universe.\n", "timestamp_created": 1733521429, "timestamp_updated": 1733521429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621387898921966553", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182010058": {"recommendationid": "182010058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042215138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2033, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1734713403}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun for a while but it's got a lot of problems.\n\n- Performance is bad even at 1080p low & frame generation for this kind of game makes things worse.

It's great that they went the non-FOMO route like Helldivers 2, where you have as much time as you need to finish the pass. Plus it's not that expensive by today's standards.\n\nGreat character skins and animations. The animations look great and there's a lot of flair/style. Good roster and there's clearly more to come.\n\nGameplay is fun and snappy. Time to kill seems faster than Overwatch.\n\nFor the negatives, my main complaint is the way you progress the battle pass. For some reason the devs have opted for a Daily Mission and Challenge-based system to reward progression. This is terrible for 3 reasons. \n\n1. Once you finish them, there's no more rewards and you are no longer incentivized to keep playing the game.\n\n2. They are all character specific, and thus make you play as those heroes to get the XP. This makes it hard to play who you want/need to play.\n\n3. Because there are challenges to do things like TAKE damage, people are incentivized to throw matches, leading to an all-over bad experience.\n\nI really hope the devs take a page from Fortnite (who did away with milestone progression a long time ago) and just let people earn progress by playing the game, doing well, and winning games.\n\nIn closing, I recommend the game and hope to see it grow and improve over time.

As of right now, the game is very familiar to other hero shooters, but presents it in a way that somehow feels a little better to play. Cross play is a breeze with little to no issues. You have an amazing selection of characters to play as, all with their own unique gimmicks, but similar mechanics so there's not too major of a learning curve. Rounds seem to move at a faster pace compared to similar games, which means you aren't really bogged down and can get right into the next round. But it is not without flaws.\n\nTo start out with, the major issue is a lot of new people picking up the game and not really understanding how game mode objectives work such as claiming a goal point or how to move it depending on the game mode. While there is a practice mode, its only really good for trying to figure out how heroes work and not really the game modes. Maybe some kind of tutorial video at the start of the game mode for lower level players that plays instead of the cinematic one for the map.\n\nAnother minor issue is with hero selection and ability summaries. While I mentioned earlier that each character has similar general mechanics, its their gimmicks that make them fun to play. To really enjoy the character, you need to learn their abilities. It would be nice to have a quick reference summary on what each ability does in hero selection instead of an entirely separate tab that requires me to read through the entire thing. It makes me feel discouraged to pick up a new hero due to the fact that I could be playing instead of reading a thesis in order to play a new character.\n\n12/11/24 Additional minor issue is terrain clipping. Some hero's may clip/get stuck in the ground when they come into contact with a surface. Playing C/D, I ended up getting stuck in the ground after using my ultimate. Playing Cap, I ended up getting stuck in a wall after shield charging. The C/D glitch happened prior to the update. But the Cap glitch happened after. I does appear from the patch notes they are aware of the issue and attempting to fix.\n\nMy most glaring issue however is the in game crafting/currency/objectives/season pass madness. It is an absolute cluster muck of items and no clear usage for any of them. Some of it I could chalk up to perhaps a bad result of attempting to make something comprehensive and navigable... some of it seems down right scummy. Who thought it would be a good idea to make, at the very least, 4 separate currencies that are all used for different things with no explanation on how they work, how they're earned, or what they're used for? You earn \"Chrono\" for completing objectives, alright fair play. But you are then supposed to use that.. in a season pass... which will constantly try to convince you that you need the Luxury version, which is paid for. That is unless you manage to see the little alt tab button that explains you, in fact, don't need to purchase the luxury version and can use chrono to unlock items. Not so bad! But then, if you look a little closer, you notice that you maybe get 2 items that can be earned through the standard pass when there are 5 is chapters total... on each tier... the other 4 being locked behind the luxury pass. One of those unlocks being the other currency you can actually use to purchase cosmetic items. I totally get that a free game needs some alternative method of money generation, but players shouldn't have to pay for things they should getting rewarded with for playing. There's enough amazing content in this game, that is incredibly unnecessary and just leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. If anything, it really steers me to avoid giving money to this game because I'm not going to enable that kind of behavior.\n\nIn summary, I think with a little polish and a major overhaul to the in-game market/reward system, I see this being the next big hero shooter game. If not... well... there's plenty of marvel shovel-ware that did the same thing.\n\n(Note: if I do see those improvements/changes, I will update this review)", "timestamp_created": 1733889650, "timestamp_updated": 1733936947, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643765032291412354", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182146464": {"recommendationid": "182146464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164685503", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1733975443}, "language": "english", "review": "I could be having fun but instead I'm stuck in an infinite loading screen when trying to start every other match I play.

I played the during the closed beta second or third wave and had a great time, since release playing with friends is impossible. I get disconnected almost every match before I even load into the game and then when I try to reconnect my slot has already been filled forcing me to not be able too get back to the game then it proceeds to give me a  penalty. This seems to be an issue that a decent amount of others are experiencing including friends that I am playing with so it does not seem to be an isolated bug. I have sent in a report as well as a ban appeal. I hope this gets fixed because at this rate the game is unplayable. P.S. the game says I have a low ping for the server I am connected to even when I use their network diagnostic tool.\n\nEDIT 1: logged back on to see if I had gotten a response and my penalty to a ONE HOUR ban from being able to joining causal match making,  from an automated system. the response time for customer support is 3-72 hours so not only am I unable to play but now have to wait a possible 3 days before I even get an answer. I have submitted ban appeal in game and contacted them on discord all of which have automated responses. I have no other issues with any other online game when it comes to my connection or playing with the friends that I am trying to play this game with. I attempted to play solo and still got the same issue after playing one game.\n\nEDIT 2: Got a response from customer support, This is the response I got. \"Dear Marvel Rivals Player,\nafter our checking, there is no relevant punishment record of the character you tell us or the punishment has already ended. Please check the character information correct or not. If you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us by tapping Settings-Help and Support-Contact us to submit your issue. Thank you for your continued support!\"\n\nThat is from submitting a report from the in game customer support system. I basically got the same thing from discord support only there they suggested updating the game or reinstalling the game. This is absurd and has turned me off of this game to the point that I personally don't know if  I will continue playing or not. They fact that they have all of my information and can't see that I have \"disconnected\" X times or that I received a penalty is crazy and the fact that across multiple different platforms there are discussions of this same issue happening and people reporting it is crazy.

This game has a ton of good with only a little bit of bad. Lets start with the good, This game is extremely fun and the IP really lends itself to this form of game. All of the characters feel extremely powerful regardless of their role. Even as a healer you feel like a super hero. The maps are really really well done. There is a quality over quantity aspect here as the game only launched with 8 normal maps and 1 arcade mode map but, the maps we do have are of really high quality. The visuals are really enjoyable in my opinion. Some of the character designs have been points of contention in the community. However, I really enjoy most of them and love seeing new versions of old heroes. The game is very active and I rarely wait even 1 second for a match after hitting the button. Now for the not so good parts, I love that they didn't opt for role queue but, I wish they would've released more vanguards and strategists. The freedom of not being forced to have 2 of each role is a great feeling but, often times people will just autolock duelists regardless of their team composition. This makes the game (especially in ranked,) less fun overall. You can choose strategist yourself and will still end up with 5 duelists which makes solo queue in ranked a near nightmare.

I think you'll be missing out if you don't start playing this game as we speak.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to summarize what defines this title:\n\n[list]\nPros:\n    [*]I need to point this out right at the beginning. The game is MODDABLE even though it's a competitive live-service game. Wanna play as CJ? Wanna mod out all those video files? Want to have skibidi toilet playing when luna snow ults? Go for it\n    [*]Every single role feels good (and most importantly fun!) to play\n    [*]In over 40 hours, I haven't encountered any meaningful bugs\n    [*]The progression system is engaging and fun; there's progression for your account XP, missions to gain progress for the current battle pass, and missions to level up your hero. At max hero level, you get a unique portrait for the UI and scoreboard, which is very nice\n    [*]The map has a lot of destructible walls/objects that I find very unique. The enemy team sitting behind the choke point? Just destroy the wall next to them\n    [*]As of now, they try to put effort into the skins they release. They fit the characters well and often have some lore background behind them\n    [*]Reporting does something. Someone's throwing? Report them and they face a penalty\n[/list]\n[list]\nThe neutral things:\n    [*]There's no role queue. While I like having no forced 2-2-2, other people probably wouldn't like this\n[/list]\n[list]\nThe not so fun things:\n    [*]The current battle pass, just like in Overwatch 2, is not worth grinding for unless you play a certain hero that has a skin in it. Though they have premium currency in it right from the beginning\n    [*]Some Heroes are unfun to play against. There's the Hanzo clone that has a seasonal damage bonus of 15% (I think?), some heroes have ults with little to no outplay (Star-Lord for example, imagine a Soldier 76 ulting you but he's in the sky, or Dr. Strange's ult that is a long AOE stun)\n    [*]The performance is BAD. I am forced to play with a potato config (while playing on an RTX 3080) just so I can keep my monitor's refresh rate as fps in fights. For a competitive game, the performance should definitely be better\n    [*]Some servers appear to be laggy? I have no way of proving this however\n    [*]Banning heroes is a thing but only when you reach Diamond (which is currently 1.5% of the player base in Europe) so until Plat you get to enjoy playing vs Hawkeye abusers\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1734901652, "timestamp_updated": 1734901730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182721006": {"recommendationid": "182721006", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203379939", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 283, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1734681749}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a banger.\nhowever rn its still pretty buggy with disconnection and then penalty for being disconnected, still good and bugs are expected for this many people playing along with a new game it just needs a bit of time for patching but still earns a positive review", "timestamp_created": 1734177640, "timestamp_updated": 1734177640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183222052": {"recommendationid": "183222052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042243497", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 2007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1908, "playtime_at_review": 1903, "last_played": 1735012809}, "language": "english", "review": "The best hero shooter released since Monday Night Combat (or TF2 if you want to include that).

You'll team up with other players, utilizing unique abilities and strategies to achieve victory across various game modes. \n\n[h2]Key Features:[/h2] \n\n*   [b]Diverse Roster:[/b] Play as a wide range of Marvel heroes and villains, each with their own distinct playstyles. From web-slinging Spider-Man to the powerful Hulk, there's a character for everyone. \n*   [b]Asymmetrical Balance:[/b] This is where Marvel Rivals truly shines. Instead of striving for perfect character balance, the game embraces imbalances, creating exciting matchups and strategic depth. This \"power play\" leads to dynamic gameplay where mastering character strengths and exploiting weaknesses is key. \n*   [b]Easy to Pick Up, Rewarding to Master:[/b] The core gameplay is intuitive and easy to grasp, making it accessible to newcomers. However, the strategic depth and intricacies of each character's abilities provide a high skill ceiling for those looking to master the game.\n*   [b]Fast-Paced 6v6 Action:[/b] Engage in thrilling team-based battles, utilizing teamwork and coordination to outmaneuver your opponents. \n\n[h2]My Experience:[/h2] \n\nI found the game consistently fun and engaging. The variety of characters, the fast-paced action, and the unique approach to balance kept me coming back for more.\n\n [h2]Pros:[/h2] \n\n*   Fun and engaging gameplay \n*   Diverse and recognizable cast of characters \n*   Unique approach to balance creates strategic depth \n*   Easy to learn, hard to master \n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2] \n\n*   Balancing may be an issue down the line. \n*   Everyone wants to play Duelist, so role queue may be something the devs want to look into. \n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2] \n\nMarvel Rivals is promising and offers a fresh take on the genre. Its focus on asymmetrical balance and diverse character abilities creates a dynamic and exciting gameplay experience.

Unless you're one of those people who seem to enjoy every game no matter how shit you do. In which case, I envy you. \r\n\r\nI truly do not understand why people who have played Overwatch, TF2 and similar hero shooters enjoy this game more somehow. Maybe it's just new game syndrome. \r\nTo start, yes I am bad at this game. I'll gladly admit that. But the game isn't at all making me want to play to get better at it either. \r\nI saw someone say recently that whoever makes a hero shooter where tanks are fun to play will be literal trillionaires, and I couldn't agree more. As a tank player I am so tired of just being completely useless in every game and just standing by watching DPS players deal 2 million damage per second and be hyper mobile and even in some cases MORE TANKY than the actual tanks. When I saw how mobile the tanks in this game were it actually ignited a tiny spark of hope in me. Maybe for once as a tank I would be able to keep up with the DPS and not be kited into oblivion all game long. But no, that was not the case. \r\nYes, tanks in this game might have mobility, but you can bet your ass most of the DPS will always have more mobility than you.
