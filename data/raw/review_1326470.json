Enormous difficulty spike playing alone. The game is very much like The Forest with a similar building/crafting system and familiar enemies but has many nice improvements compared to the first game.\n\nMy favorite addition has to be Kelvin, having a npc collect resources while you focus on more important projects is a huge time saver. Second favorite would be the new map system. \n\nSons of the forest doesn't hold your hand with most of its mechanics so it forces you to improvise or search up how things work. Inventory is very large (easy to overlook corners). Cabins and other structures take less resources to build compared to the first game (Huge Plus). Enemies do one hit critical damage without armor (challenging alone). When your character is exhausted you're still able to move around with minimal restraints to build and recover necessary items to heal. Very forgiving (Huge Plus).\n\nLarge map, Many side quests, Seasonal Weather Survival, Interesting Characters.

For me a 10/10.\r\nI absolutely loved The Forest. There were years where I did not play games and The Forest got me back into gaming. I feel equally strongly about Sons of the Forest. I truly hope this game provides even further evidence that Indie developers are the future of the gaming industry. \r\n\r\nI also love that the game is dense with horror canon references and influences. Alien, The Thing, Event Horizon ( I think that is the basis of the story in terms of portals to other dimensions being opened up) and many others.\r\n\r\nI have read complaints about the building mechanics but the little bit I tried in my first quick play through seemed quite user friendly and intuitive yet allows for wide ranging creativity. I have seen some awe inspiring structures on YouTube. \r\n\r\nMy only two small complaints would be the combat and the survival mechanics. I could be wrong but the enemies don't feel as intelligent as in The Forest or at the very least they are not smarter. In the beginning their aggression is intimidating but after a few hours attacks can easily be managed as they are quite predictable. \r\n\r\nIn terms of survival mechanics these were not much of an improvement from the original. I would have preferred deeper and more complex mechanics: Green Hell or even tougher. From an accessibility/sales perspective I can see why developers would steer away from this as it could potentially alienate many players.\r\n\r\nMy ideal would be tough survival mechanics and then intelligent and brutal enemy attacks on a relatively infrequent basis. This would add immensely to the horror.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the next game.

I no longer need to leave home enjoy nature. if this was just a forest walking simulator id buy it. The original holds up but this is next level.\r\n\r\nQOL:  features are very welcome, having 10 quick bind options is great and a larger inventory. The gps is a much welcome feature for such a large map. Being able to place a tarp and stick to save is incredible. Kelvin gives the full teammate experience, but better. a little bit special and wont listen sometimes, but isnt apposed to hard labour. having him collect sticks and finish structures is very nice when playing solo.\r\n\r\nBuilding: i like how much freedom the game gives with what can be done, and its quite fun. also kelvin being able to collect sticks and fallen logs is great.\r\n\r\nCombat: The crafted bow in the original could carry the entire game, SOF though i found myself not using it. the damage done by cave cannibal can kill you in one to two hits so blocking and dodging are a must where the original cannibals could just be brute forced even in hard. The added guns can take out cannibals with \r\nheadshots but arent worth using on mutants. \r\n\r\nGameplay: the general game play feels more polished, which obviously but its nice. the progression while still based around collected items there is markers and POI's on the gps which help with natural feeling progression, I dont know how someone could complete the original game blind, in a reasonable amount of time, without external help. \r\n\r\nCons\r\nBuilding: can be alot more tedious than the original. like building a wall then manually spiking every log afterwards.\r\n\r\nMap: The original forest never felt small but SOF feels massive, not in a \"wow so much to see\" but a \"Oh ive only moved that far\". the vehicles do help but it feels like a tacked on solution after realising how long it takes to walk. Personally if the map was half the size it would feel better. \r\n\r\nCombat: The amount of mutants and cannibals in some caves makes it unfun to fight them, and you just end up running. I might just be bad but its annoying being attacked by 5 different enemies at once that can one shot you. I could understand when the guns, particularly shotgun actually did damage but after being nerfed to the ground its only really good for regular cannibals. id rather have the ammo be made more scarce and buff the damage. so when you need a tone of firepower you can. \r\n\r\nThis is just the things ive thought off so far, overall good game recommend, but has some annoyances. wait for a special. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734970761, "timestamp_updated": 1734970761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50777202844619751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183479317": {"recommendationid": "183479317", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445514120", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1469, "playtime_at_review": 1193, "last_played": 1735051180}, "language": "english", "review": "played 19.9 hours in 3days, can say building is like therapy, very relaxing, graphic a solid 10/10 made very good, gameplay wise, i love the new mecanics, unlike in the forest you can do lots more things in this game, ont thing i dont like is the inventory, is so slow to navigate sometimes, this game is very optimized,  i can easily run 80-100fps in ultra, and i get no fps drops the more i play, unlike the forest in day 0, 150fps, day 25, 60fps, it was frustrateing, i highly recomand playing with friends that never played it, since is way batter to discover everything, to bad i played mostly myself but this is still a 10/10 game (BRING BOATS BACK)", "timestamp_created": 1734962261, "timestamp_updated": 1734962261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50777202844619751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183426383": {"recommendationid": "183426383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082778954", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 619, "playtime_at_review": 1994, "last_played": 1734489058}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Decent story until the final fourth of the game.\n- Beautiful environments with dynamic weather that changes gameplay patterns.\n- Satisfying progressive elements like new weapons and schematic discoveries.\n- Mysterious hidden places adding unique flavor to the story.\n\nCons:\n- The last fourth of the game feels incredibly rushed, to the point that it ALMOST ruins the story.

You crash land, meet some very \"friendly\" locals (aka, nightmare-inducing cannibals), and suddenly, you're a lumberjack, architect, and cannibal whisperer rolled into one. The survival mechanics are so detailed that I now genuinely fear dehydration IRL.\n\nThe real star of the show? Kelvin, your trusty AI companion who operates on vibes alone. Need logs? He\u2019ll bring you a few... or maybe drown himself trying. He\u2019s like that one coworker who tries hard but leaves chaos in their wake. And let's not forget Virginia, the three-legged, gun-wielding ballerina who somehow became my squad MVP.\n\nCombat is intense, especially when a mutant shows up and you realize you forgot to craft literally anything useful. So, you scream, flail your axe, and pray your wall of poorly placed spikes works. Spoiler: It won\u2019t.\n\nI knocked off a star because the cannibals have better fashion sense than me.

Let\u2019s break it down.\r\n\r\n[h2] Map Design and Navigation [/h2]\r\nThe map is [b] way too big [/b], and instead of feeling immersive, it just feels like a chore to get around. The GPS system? [b] A disaster [/b]. It either spoon-feeds you the next objective, taking away any sense of discovery, or leaves you completely lost. Plus, trying to use the map is a pain, you can\u2019t easily move it around or get a better view, which only adds to the frustration.\r\n\r\n[h2] Base Building and Survival Mechanics [/h2]\r\nBase building has gone from being a highlight in the first game to feeling [i] pointless [/i] here. The system has been changed, but not for the better, it\u2019s clunky and finicky, and honestly, there\u2019s no real reason to build anything. You can finish the game without a base, and the survival mechanics are so basic that you don\u2019t even need to craft, hunt, or farm. Just live off MREs, soda cans, and pills scattered around the map. The [b] strength system [/b]? Completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n[h2] Storytelling and Immersion [/h2]\r\nThe story is barely there. You\u2019re thrown onto this island with no clear purpose, and as you play, there\u2019s little explanation for why your character keeps pushing forward. It\u2019s like the game forgot to give you a reason to care.\r\n\r\n[h2] Difficulty and Balance [/h2]\r\nThe difficulty is [b] all over the place [/b]. On hard mode, even with three experienced players, one cave took us three hours to complete. On easy mode, though, the entire game can be beaten in just four hours. There\u2019s no real balance here, and it makes the game feel either punishing or way too short.\r\n\r\nBase building is especially punishing. If you try to settle down, you\u2019ll be [b]swarmed by cannibals[/b] within the hour. It gets so bad that building a base becomes more of a liability than an advantage.\r\n\r\n[h2] Cannibals and Island Atmosphere [/h2]\r\nSpeaking of cannibals, they\u2019re everywhere. This completely ruins the deserted-island vibe the original game nailed. Instead of feeling like a mysterious, abandoned place, the island feels [i] overrun [/i]\u2014it\u2019s more like the cannibals just live there full-time.\r\n\r\n[h2] Miscellaneous Issues [/h2]\r\nThere are a ton of smaller problems that pile up:\r\n\r\nVehicles are [i] awkward and out of place [/i], and they make little to no sense in the context of the game.\r\nProgression is confusing. For example, you suddenly need a special blueprint with no prior warning, and there\u2019s no way to know this without looking up a guide.\r\nA lot of the interactable elements feel meaningless. Camps of crash survivors with glowing flares, for instance, always result in the same thing\u2014people dying \u201cjust as you arrive.\u201d It\u2019s repetitive and immersion-breaking.\r\n[h2] Visuals [/h2]\r\nThe game does look [b] amazing [/b]. The environments are detailed and polished, but unfortunately, great visuals can\u2019t save a game with so many gameplay issues.\r\n\r\n[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]\r\nSons of the Forest is a good-looking game with a lot of problems. Its oversized map, clunky mechanics, and lack of meaningful progression make it feel hollow and frustrating. If you\u2019re into exploration, you might get some enjoyment, but for most players, it\u2019s just not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved the original The Forest, having played it through multiple times with various groups of friends, and was expecting a vastly improved experience this time around, and have been significantly let down. Even at the 50% sale price point of ~\u00a313, this was not worth it. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734817524, "timestamp_updated": 1734817524, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183320365": {"recommendationid": "183320365", "author": {"steamid": "76561199774092309", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 331, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1735056048}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is really fun, the visuals are wild i really think its a very good sequal to The forest a little buggy but very fun with friends, the game is good i look forward to play many hours more and enjoy the beautiful world of Sons OF The Forest", "timestamp_created": 1734814624, "timestamp_updated": 1734814624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183318375": {"recommendationid": "183318375", "author": {"steamid": "76561199698935592", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2368, "playtime_at_review": 2537, "last_played": 1735060667}, "language": "english", "review": "sons of the forest is realy good game but you need a powerfull pc to run it if you loved forest sons of the forest is the perfect game for you i like that there is guns in the game and the new canibal ai", "timestamp_created": 1734813046, "timestamp_updated": 1734813046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183316053": {"recommendationid": "183316053", "author": {"steamid": "76561199735707963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4490, "playtime_at_review": 3893, "last_played": 1734919072}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

lore is- no idea didnt look for it! the setting customization is strangely indepth for camera's and shit! the combat is fun, new shit from the last game is super cool! however much like the last game! unless you have friends or an endless supply of dopamine from another dimension. it gets really boring really fast. after about 10 hours of gameplay is when it hit for me, away from my friends i mean! i played my own game solo and it sucked. i had alot of fun cutting trees and beating mutants but then i died alot, had noone to talk to, and fell into a silence while cutting thousands of trees for barely any progress on my already tiny base. the base building system is much better than the forest itself, being able to customize it is amazing and the depth is more than mediocre! but the amount of stuff you need to just make a 2x2x1 log box is so much that it isnt fun after a while. the combat is difficult but fun, though far enough in it just feels like your fighting meatshields. early on the meatshields are scary and hard to kill makeing shit more fun! but when theres 5 every few nights breaking down a house that took you that many nights to repair from the last attack. it hurts to see. \r\n\r\nTLDR: No friends makes the game suck, the enemy difficulty and the building costs suck, some shit is better though :Thumbsup: \r\n\r\nPlay it with friends, its so much better!!!!!
