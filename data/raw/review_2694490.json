What I like the best is that money and inventory is shared between all of your characters so during the initial grind with your first/main character you can save gear and weapons you find for other characters you intend to play later. It is very convenient. My biggest criticism is that the personal inventory is so small that you have to constantly go back and forth to camp to identify and sell items while playing, unless of course you just don't pick anything up. This game encourages you to find a good/solid starting item and upgrade it instead of always depending on the initial magic or rare drops. There is a good deal of grinding in this game so hopefully you don't mind that. All maps and bosses are re-playable as many times as you want. If you can't get a map to reload just control click the name of the map at the entrance and you can start a \"new\" run of it. Another criticism I have is that jewels don't drop quite enough. I have only had 4 drop in 56 hours of play and none of them will work for my warrior so it is very frustrating.

So if you can not do a boss fight your forever stuck in a low level area until you can kill the boss and the boss fights are extremely difficult to unbalanced in the game, very poor development decision to do something so stupid to your player base. Do not recommend buying early access and when the game becomes free to play maybe try it then but most players will become gated or stuck in a low level zone unable to progress to end game content. I think they will probably adjust the boss difficulty in the future currently the tuneing of the boss fights are very difficult the game developers might adjust the difficulty down to save a lot of people quitting the game because of the gating issue. My experience was the bosses in the first act werer very difficult when i got to the last boss of the first act got stuck could not do the boss with my mercenary build so i was not bad at the game could work and use my hero very well but the last boss fight was not fun very much thought the damage and mechanics of the boss was nearly impossible and i have been playing these games for years. I think blocking players from progression so early in the game buy making bosses so difficult to defeat will cause a lot of players to stop playing path of the exile.

Here's why:\n\n1- Gambling Mechanics Disguised as Gameplay\nThe game is essentially a glorified gambling simulator. Whether it\u2019s crafting items or farming for currency, everything feels like rolling dice with abysmal odds. The endless grind to get even marginally good gear feels more punishing than rewarding.\n\n2- Dodge Roll Simulator\nCombat has devolved into a dodge roll simulation. Every encounter feels like you're just trying to avoid being one-shot by enemies rather than engaging in meaningful mechanics. It\u2019s repetitive, frustrating, and lacks depth.\n\n3- Overly Long and Boring Campaign\nThe campaign feels unnecessarily stretched out. It\u2019s a tedious slog that overstays its welcome and lacks the excitement and pacing expected from modern ARPGs. For a sequel, it feels outdated and uninspired.\n\n4- The Worst Trading System in Any ARPG\nThe trading system is horrendous. Instead of a proper in-game auction house, players are forced to rely on an external trading website. It\u2019s clunky, inefficient, and downright archaic. In 2024, this approach is unacceptable for a game of this scale.\n\n5- Not Much Different From Path of Exile 1\nPath of Exile 2 barely feels like a new game. The visuals and mechanics are slightly improved, but it\u2019s essentially PoE 1 with a fresh coat of paint. And to add insult to injury, they\u2019re planning to charge players for Early Access, which makes it feel like a cash grab.\n\n6- Constant Nerfs and Build Limitations\nDespite claiming you can create any build with any class, the reality is far from it. The developers constantly nerf builds, especially ones popularized by top streamers. It creates a toxic cycle where the moment you find something fun or viable, it\u2019s nerfed into the ground, leaving players scrambling to rebuild from scratch.\n\n7- Broken Promises About Build Diversity\nThe idea that \u201cany build works with any class\u201d is a blatant lie. The game funnels players into chasing the META, and anything outside of it is simply unviable. It\u2019s disappointing that the promise of freedom is nothing more than a marketing gimmick.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI know it's still Early Access but Path of Exile 2 could have been a groundbreaking sequel, but instead, it feels like a half-baked rehash of PoE 1 riddled with frustrating mechanics and broken promises. Unless significant changes are made, it\u2019s hard to recommend this game to anyone but the most die-hard fans. For everyone else, it\u2019s better to look elsewhere for your ARPG fix.", "timestamp_created": 1735053388, "timestamp_updated": 1735053388, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422535210847854614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183573856": {"recommendationid": "183573856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166595332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3521, "playtime_at_review": 3521, "last_played": 1735052529}, "language": "english", "review": "In its current state the game is fun, but really tough.

Armor %, Es. \n\nEssentially the pinnacle of what you can obtain prior to level 20. \n\nFast forward to any boss fight, You are sitting there struggling to get mana and hp potions after about 3 minutes of the fight going on. Your damage that felt like it was destroying everything, Is like a tickle to the boss. I even attempted to over level and go back and re attempt it. But still the same result.\n\nThere is some sort of developer induced fake difficulty at this time. The ONLY people who are playing this, are the ones who watch streamers, and follow builds. Someone found one good build that deletes everything regardless of gear, And everyone follows that build. Plays it for a month, then spends the currency on other builds.

An otherwise great game if it weren't for the god awful ascendancy system. \n\nFor some reason, the devs decided to lock ascendancy points behind two roguelite systems: The Trial of Sekhemas, and the Trial of Chaos. The Trial of Sekhemas is especially bad, as to progress through the trial, you have to navigate your way through debuffs and rewards. The problem is, more often than not, you can't avoid the negative debuffs, and they are brutal. They can make your otherwise very strong character hit like a wet noodle, or remove all your defensive stats, or even speed up the animation speed of enemies, including bossess, making it borderline impossible to attack without taking a hit. \n\nAnother thing about The Trial of Sekhemas is the honour system, which is effectively another health bar, which can only be replenished minutely through fountains that you may or may not encounter as rewards during your progression of the trial. And if your 'honour bar' becomes fully depleted, you fail, and lose the token you used to access the trial. \n\nI could go on, but honestly everything I have said has already been said by much of the player-base, and this is more of a plea for change than an actual negative review. I do recommend the game, but my god this current system of ascendancy trials sucks ass.\n\n(I will change my review of this otherwise fantastic game when they rework the entirety of the current system of acquiring ascendancy points.)", "timestamp_created": 1735046467, "timestamp_updated": 1735046467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183565209": {"recommendationid": "183565209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015617327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3901, "playtime_at_review": 4815, "last_played": 1735055118}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, this is not d4 :)", "timestamp_created": 1735046369, "timestamp_updated": 1735046369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183565071": {"recommendationid": "183565071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083186801", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1986, "playtime_at_review": 1956, "last_played": 1735058198}, "language": "english", "review": "Lmao Dog trash Dodge/roll mechanics please delete it\n\nSIck Fuck in the head devs wtf is wrong with u ? why gib small inv in an loot based arpg ?? ! \n\nTp every 5 min WHY ??? just fucking why", "timestamp_created": 1735046250, "timestamp_updated": 1735056423, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.334232479333877563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183565038": {"recommendationid": "183565038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088611845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2194, "playtime_at_review": 3545, "last_played": 1734545201}, "language": "english", "review": "Better then POE 1.

Set in the dark, immersive world of Wraeclast, it offers a complex and rewarding experience reminiscent of the original Diablo series and for that reason alone I would love it! BUT it is sooo much more.\r\n\r\nOne of the game's standout features is its extensive character customisation. The passive skill tree is a sprawling network of over 1,300 nodes, allowing players to craft unique builds tailored to their preferred playstyle. This depth is further enhanced by the skill gem system, where abilities are linked to equipment, enabling a vast array of combinations and strategies. Such complexity ensures that both new and veteran players can find endless opportunities for experimentation and personal builds etc.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is engaging and challenging, with procedurally generated areas that keep each playthrough fresh and unpredictable. Combat is fluid and satisfying, demanding both strategic planning and quick reflexes. The game encourages creative interactions between skills for instance, casting a frost bolt through a wall of flame results in a flaming frost bolt, adding layers of tactical depth and surprise to encounters.\r\n\r\nFor those who appreciate the atmospheric and gritty aesthetic of the early Diablo games, Path of Exile delivers a nostalgic yet modern experience. The dark fantasy setting, combined with a haunting musical score, creates an immersive environment that draws players into its lore-rich world.\r\n\r\nConsidering its free-to-play model, Path of Exile offers exceptional value. The developers have committed to avoiding pay-to-win mechanics, focusing on cosmetic items and account features, ensuring that gameplay remains fair and skill-based. Regular updates and expansions have continually enriched the game, introducing new content and mechanics that keep the experience fresh and engaging.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Path of Exile is a remarkable ARPG that combines deep character customisation, engaging gameplay, and a richly crafted world. Its homage to the classic Diablo series, coupled with innovative mechanics and a fair pricing model, makes it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or new to action RPGs, Path of Exile offers a rewarding and immersive adventure well worth your time.\r\n\r\nThere in short I like this game!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1735045220, "timestamp_updated": 1735045220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183563864": {"recommendationid": "183563864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025734482", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4339, "playtime_at_review": 6753, "last_played": 1734980693}, "language": "english", "review": "Act 1-3 are pretty good and resemble an actual game where you get better via skill and gear progression.\r\nAfterwards it falls apart through the repeat of acts and endgame is just dogshit where u either have a build where u one shot everything or u die by one shot.

have enjoyed over 1000 hours in POE 1, and played all diablo games, last epoch, warhammer inquisitor etc.\n\nThe game is still in early access and it can be felt, there is some aspects of the game that I believe needs to change, and they probably will before the release.\nThe largest issue, which I find is the same as POE 1 is stability, disconnections and crashes are far too frequent, and while it is early access, I find it unacceptable, if it is only as stabel as POE 1, I find myself crashing roughly once per hour, and in POE 1 it was not much different either.\n\nI like their gem system, while it could do with fine tuning, I have not seen it anywhere else, so for me that is probably also the only \"unique\" thing about POE 2, compared to other games.\nThe adoption of WASD is also done very well, you do not find it often in these games, and I think I would have found it harder, if I had not played it in warhammer inquisitor.\n\nWhat I like most about the game is probably the feel of progression, especially in campaign, playing with a friend we reached the very hard bosses in the acts, we died and we overcome the challenge, I would say I prefer coop over single player in this aspect, as it becomes quite a bit harder when you solo it.\nAnd then the dophamine hit with drops of course (loot filter required), I do not think I can remember any game since diablo 2, which can give that boost (exccluding poe 1).\n\nLooking forward to a lot of fine tuning, and the rest of the acts, classes and ascendencies.", "timestamp_created": 1735043677, "timestamp_updated":

She has robbed me of 80 hours in just over 2 weeks already, I simply cannot stop the grind.\r\nPros:\r\n- Very satisfying minute to minute gameplay. Sounds feel crisp and punchy, animations are great, the visual effects are stunning.\r\n- It dances the fine line of having incredible depth and complexity in terms of build customization, while still making that complexity intuitive and simple enough to understand with relative ease. The passive skill tree being the perfect example for that. Specific attributes are clustered in \"constellations\" on the skill tree, for example a large sword consisting of several upgrades that all enhance swords in some way, or a lightning bolt for lightning damage upgrades.\r\n- Visually stunning, both in sheer graphics, and also all of the design choices. Armor looks fantasy, yet realistic, monsters look monstrous, without going into cartoonish or upsettingly gory (with a few intentional exceptions).\r\n- BOSSES! Bosses feel difficult, yet fair. Learning their attack patterns feels rewarding. A *couple* of them are a bit too easy, but that might've had to do with getting very lucky with my build the first time i attempted them.\r\n- The story is engaging, and progresses at a nice pace. I've completed the current 3 available acts several times now and still enjoy going through it.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Controls definitely need some tweaking by the time 1.0 release comes around, both M/KB and Gamepad controls.\r\n\u2514 M/KB aim on ranged attacks feels off, because your character shoots at the chest/head height of the spot on the ground that you click on, meaning shooting up and down is accurate, but shooting left and right has a really annoying offset. This is the main reason I prefer using Gamepad controls (which has heavy aim-assist, practically auto-aim).\r\n\u2514 Gamepad doesn't allow you to rebind controls (as of writing this review), and the A button is contextual. Meaning, when enemies around it acts as an ability, but when there are no enemies nearby it's the button used for picking loot up. When you wanna pick something up while enemies are around, you need to finagle the right stick at the same time as pressing A to hopefully pick up the item you intended to take, which can be incredibly frustrating.\r\n\u2514 Overall it feels like both options have pros that the other option SHOULD also easily have, but simply doesn't.\r\n- The game could do a better job explaining some of the more intricate details that become more important in the late game, such as Vaal orbs, item modifier tiers, and whatever else there is that I am still discovering. But I expect this to change by the time 1.0 comes out.\r\n\r\nOverall, highly recommend this game, it's a ton of fun.\r\nPS: If you get the early access including the paid currency, WAIT FOR A STASH TAB SALE AND SPEND IT ON STASH TABS OH MY GOD I HAD NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT STASH TABS BECOME IN THE LATE GAME AAAHHH!!!", "timestamp_created": 1735043187, "timestamp_updated": 1735043187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183561604": {"recommendationid": "183561604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060120800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 9924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6462, "playtime_at_review": 9667, "last_played": 1735057634}, "language": "english", "review": "A", "timestamp_created": 1735043091, "timestamp_updated": 1735043091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457792937755584717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183561583": {"recommendationid": "183561583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111109568", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 4329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2437, "playtime_at_review": 4329, "last_played": 1735042642}, "language": "english", "review": "no.\r\nThe amount of shit you have to memorize to be able to play this game comfortably is infuriating.

This game doesn't just redeem the ARPG genre; it sets a new standard.\n\nFrom the moment I started playing Path of Exile 2, it was clear that Grinding Gear Games (GGG) understood what players wanted. The developers didn't just listen; they absorbed every piece of feedback from the original Path of Exile and used it to craft something truly special. Unlike Diablo 4, where the loot system felt like a chore, PoE 2 respects your time. Loot drops are meaningful, not just a sea of numbers you sift through hoping for something decent.\n\nThe atmosphere in Path of Exile 2 is what I expected from a dark, fantasy ARPG. It's gritty, it's dark, and honestly, it's terrifying at times. Every map feels like a new chapter in a dark, twisted tale, making you feel like you're truly exploring the depths of Wraeclast rather than just another reskinned zone.\n\nCommunity? PoE 2 nails it. There's a genuine sense of cooperation and competition. The game's design encourages interaction in a way that feels natural, not forced. It's clear GGG values player interaction, providing tools and systems that foster a healthy, engaging community. This is worlds apart from the toxic environment that sometimes plagued Diablo 4.\n\nThe story in PoE 2, while not its main draw, is compelling in its own right. It's woven into the gameplay in a way that makes you want to uncover more. Characters have depth, and the narrative feels like it's moving forward with you, not just around you.\n\nCombat in Path of Exile 2 is where it really shines, offering a level of precision and responsiveness that Diablo 4 lacked. Every class feels unique, with a skill tree so vast it's like painting your own masterpiece. The developers have given players the freedom to experiment, fail, and then succeed in ways Diablo 4's more rigid class system never allowed. \n\nOne of the most refreshing aspects is how GGG handles monetization. Path of Exile 2 remains free-to-play, with cosmetics that feel like a genuine reward for supporting a game you love, not a necessity to enjoy it. This approach is a stark contrast to Diablo 4's aggressive microtransaction model, which felt more like a paywall than an optional enhancement.\n\nIn essence, Path of Exile 2 feels like a love letter to ARPG fans. GGG has not only learned from their past but has also learned from the mistakes of others in the genre. They've delivered a game that respects the player's intelligence, time, and passion for the genre. Diablo 4 might have had the big budget and the big name, but Path of Exile 2 has the heart, the soul, and the dedication to what makes these games special. It's clear where the true passion for ARPGs lies, and it's not with Blizzard's latest offering.", "timestamp_created": 1735037074, "timestamp_updated": 1735037074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183555802": {"recommendationid": "183555802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053535676", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2059, "playtime_at_review": 2020, "last_played": 1735039317}, "language": "english", "review": "is gud", "timestamp_created": 1735036928, "timestamp_updated": 1735036928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183555779": {"recommendationid": "183555779", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224686827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1151, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1735055174}, "language": "english", "review": "The build variety is incredible, and they\u2019ve streamlined the overly complicated and unnecessary designs from POE1.

Love the challenge that is present, honestly so refreshing to play. Also very happy they let you respec which you could not do in POE 1 which made the game a huge time sync to either learn or fail miserably at. This game is very fun with a ton of different ways to spec and play the 6 classes out of 12 present. Easy enough to play it like an arcade experience and has the depth to bust out a spreadsheet if you that's your thing. \r\n\r\nMostly played on PC but the game runs amazingly on Steam Deck with most settings on low. The graphics getting turned down on that size screen is a negligible difference for a great handheld experience. Plays very well M&K or on controller. Gotta mention, I love the ability to pause the game at any time if you are not partied up so that you can tend to life then pick back up right where you left off rather than hunt for a stopping point or die and lose progress.\r\n\r\nHats off to the devs for being decent people, they truly deserve the love this game is getting! Early Access gives you in game cosmetic currency at the same rate you would pay to get it when it launches F2P so no predatory money grabbing either. Game has more polish than so much of what comes out these days and the devs have a great record of supporting POE 1,\r\n\r\nShut up and take my money!", "timestamp_created": 1735035735, "timestamp_updated": 1735035735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183554728": {"recommendationid": "183554728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296969900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1029, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1735039145}, "language": "english", "review": "They made it too difficult", "timestamp_created": 1735035701, "timestamp_updated": 1735035701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462972849607467651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183554646": {"recommendationid": "183554646", "author": {"steamid": "76561199623388596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 890, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1735057882}, "language": "english", "review": "My buddy asked me what I wanted for a gift this year, and my answer was: POE2!", "timestamp_created": 1735035604, "timestamp_updated": 1735035604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183554644": {"recommendationid": "183554644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052650883", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3741, "playtime_at_review": 3741, "last_played": 1734731781}, "language": "english", "review": "POE 1 = What Diablo 3 should have been\nPOE 2 = What Diablo 4 should have been\n\nGrinding Gear Games continues to set the gold standard.

I have picked it up and done my own thing from the start, there is no guide or anything like it so I amuse its not \"Good\" but its been a blast, (Mostly fire Sorc Chronomancer, basically what nobody is doing it seems).\n\nin the Campaign Bosses are AWESOME almost dark soul level and this is only possible with the awesome WASD controls or controller unless you are super fast but it  was a game changer.\n\nWhere I have an  Issue is end game, I love my weied build, it was good enough to get through up to a T7 map so far and i feel way further but the map system is brutal and VERY punishing. If you fail you not only loose the Waystone to enter but all modifiers are wiped. Bosses are one of these modifiers, I went through like 20 maps before i realized bosses were even a thing because I was dying and that makes the maps no modifier worthless wastes of time and completely eliminates wat I found the most fun. \nI love hard games but am not a top player, like i feel may of us are. I Just want to have fun with the game, by making it effectively I have to do every map PERFECT to even have a chance at a boss and having fun is WAY too brutal,  I don't even mind being punished with loosing the maps just don't wipe the modifiers that makes the entirety of end game just basic dungeons for any build that isnt meta good. I cant see how this would possibly make it worse for better players it only makes less good people want to quit before they get good.\nLast Map Drops are terrible, i did great at the start cleared up to a VI but got no drops for a new VI, I have been stuck trying to  get past V for like 20 maps now, I feel no difference in a T1 to a T5 or 7 for that matter; difficulty wise I still clear just as fast still can get taken down in less than a sec if I'm not perfect (I know its cuz my build is trash probably but let me have fun how does that hurt better players).\n\nMake end game fun/rewarding by allowing us to fail a map but still have modifiers otherwise the game is terrible for low skill players making it a vanilla slog through trash mobs endlessly with a random 1 shot that resets you. At least give us a chance to kill a boss.\n\nMake Map drops better it sucks having to do a T2 that you get near no EXP, No better maps nothing really for your effort just waiting for RNG god to let you get some exp by dropping a higher tier map and hoping that chain keeps up. Probobly easy for meta builds but absolutrly brutal on anyone who wants to just have fun without copying a build guide.\n\nI love the base game but PLEASE let us keep having fun I don't see how it hurts anyone to let us redo maps and still have the modifiers, I don't even mind having to farm the better tier that much just please let us have the ability to fight a boss once in a while even if we don't clear the maps first try every try.", "timestamp_created": 1735034995, "timestamp_updated": 1735034995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183554169": {"recommendationid": "183554169", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973462955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2169, "playtime_at_review": 2128, "last_played": 1735037483}, "language": "english", "review": "Path of Exile 2 feels like stepping back into the dark, gritty world of Diablo 2, but this time with the perfect glow-up.

First of all forget Path of Exile one, it is not this game, it will be less painful this way. Secondly remember that this is Early Access! Game not released, not optimized and not even in half way done. \n\nIf you take this two point into consideration - game already great and have insane potential. Style, Music, Narratives, Classes and abilities, Items and Economy, Endgame. All is great or at least have a solid foundation. Game is slow and require that you \"Stay awhile and listen\" ( Yes there is a LOT of Diablo references, devs are huge nerds ). Many items or mechanics are overpowered or unbalanced, but that is why it is fun journey of discovery and one of the strongest parts of the game!!! Game will change and grow and in few years you will not believe your eyes, gods just look how first Path of Exile changed over the last 15 years!\n\nAs original baker I have my high hopes that GGG delivers and last 15 years proves it. So hop in the hype train friend!\n\nFrom negatives there is a lot to balance, optimize and fix. But remember, this is an \"Early Access\", right. Chill and take it lightly, this is how games developed in this era.\n\nI cannot sure you that it will be masterpiece. GGG always do more but less polished.

Do you people really play the game you make? And the reward is not even attractive! You are forcing yourself to do it just to get the fucking atlas point. And to do what? farm the content that you are already farming! Holy that is some next level brainrot design.\r\nOne portal per map needs to go. Whoever designed this need to be fired. You tried to copy LE we get it, you failed let's move on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit's like they have learned nothing in POE1. Pretty much every single aspect of the game that they want to \"fix\" only got worse. On death effect still exist, Magic find still exist (they literally just nerfed this shit in POE1), Crafting which is one of the unique part of POE is gone in POE2. The drop rates for league specific crafting mats are incredibly low. And there is no harvest reforge which I think is the best crafting system in POE1. \r\n\r\nThe only right thing they did in POE2 is just better graphics and animation. I think the art team did a great job on the despite a lot of visual clarity issues. The concerning problem is the flaw and arrogance in core game design. I do not know why Jonathan is so eager to fight against players. In GGG's \"vision\", everything needs to have a \"friction\u201c and \"weight\" which their sole purpose is to annoy player or slow them down. Like come on dude, we are here to kill monsters and get loot, not to suffer. If people want that, they can go play souls like. Those game have way better graphics better combat better story. And the most important part is that it is a one time experience for most of the players. ARPG in general is more about being replayable in the long term. But in POE2, they put so many frustration and bullshit to punish the player for just playing the game. Like why do you put on death effect in POE2, players already complained about this a lot in POE1, and you arrogant still put those in the game and made them 10x worse by limiting player movement and close to none visual clarity. Why do you make people go through such a long hall way, wait for elevator, wait for the door to open in trial of chaos? Why do you make the campaign zone this big with literally nothing interesting in it? Why do you make some boss entrance 10 second long? There are a lot more small things like this in POE2 just to slow players down for no reason. Meanwhile the developers in the office are like: HAH we got'em! No, fuck you and your \"friction\".

I\u2019ve never been one to get deep into the end game and play them more for getting through the campaign and leveling up. I had heard that over the years the first game became something that people really fell in love with. So I was interested to see how 2 would evolve.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say this really is just as fun as early previews/reviews mentioned. After about 50 hours I got through the 3 currently available Acts with 1 class and now have the harder NG+ to get through as well as the endgame. But I am also left with the desire to play through with a different class to see what that is like.\r\n\r\nI think the thing that sets this game apart from other ARPGs is the ability to dodge roll no matter the class with no limitations like stamina. This alone makes it so enemies and bosses can be designed around needing to have good timing and positioning which for some Veteran ARPG players probably takes some getting used to. But overall I think it succeeds in making the combat feel satisfying and also provides a good challenge even on standard.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to developer communication they have been doing great thus far. From being constant and quick with the day 1 launch issues, to now addressing concerns and upcoming changes. They very clearly want to please the player base both from a hardcore and casual perspective and care a lot about the game.\r\n\r\nAs it stands I think there is more than enough content currently in the game to justify the early access price.

Losing a map, experience, and significant progress due to a single mistake feels incredibly unfair.\r\n\r\nTedious Maps: Maps are too large, visually cluttered, and often require navigating through frustrating chokepoints. Boss encounters are buried within these tedious maps, adding unnecessary grind.\r\n\r\nWorthless Low-Level Content: Low-level maps offer no meaningful rewards, making them completely pointless. This forces players to constantly engage with the frustrating high-level content.\r\n\r\nQuestionable Gem System: The new gem system hinders character progression and contributes to early game balance issues.\r\n\r\nFrustrating Ascendancy System: The ascendancy system is locked behind RNG-heavy encounters, making it unnecessarily difficult to experiment with different builds.\r\n\r\nLimited Build Diversity: While early game offers build diversity, the endgame funnels players into specific builds that can survive the brutal one-shots.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly:\r\n\r\nTrading Trivializes Progression: The ability to trade for high-level gems and gear completely trivializes the progression system, allowing players to bypass the core challenges of the game.\r\n\r\nBalance Issues: The game suffers from significant balance issues, particularly with armor, damage scaling, and the spirit system.\r\n\r\nOverall:\r\n\r\nPath of Exile 2, in its current early access state, is a disappointment. It feels like a missed opportunity to improve upon the foundation of Path of Exile.  The game is plagued by questionable design choices, brutal difficulty spikes, and a lack of meaningful progression. \r\n\r\nRecommendation:\r\n\r\nWait for substantial updates and reworks before purchasing.

Loot is mostly junk, and meaningful upgrades feel like rare accidents. Trading is an absolute chore. Instead of a streamlined system like an auction house, you are stuck searching trade sites, whispering players one by one, and hoping they respond. It is tedious and wastes time that could be spent actually playing.\n\nThe endgame is another disappointment. Once you finish the campaign, it is just maps. Over and over. The content feels repetitive, and without variety or engaging progression, you can burn out on it in under two weeks unless you want to grind endlessly for minor improvements.\n\nThe game also loves to slow you down in ways that feel more frustrating than challenging. On-death effects like explosions punish you for killing a boss by blowing you up when you go to grab loot. It is not clever; it is just annoying.\n\nCo-op, which should be a highlight, is riddled with issues. Bugs often leave players stuck behind while their friends move ahead, and instead of being able to port to them, you are forced to fight through mobs that are scaled for the whole group. These enemies hit hard and are far from solo-friendly, making it an absolute slog to catch up. Even when you are together, the screen becomes so visually cluttered that it is impossible to tell what is safe and what is dangerous.\n\nWhile the early-game build variety is fantastic, the endgame punishes anything outside of meta builds designed for screen-clearing efficiency. The creativity and experimentation that make the early game fun completely disappear, and you are left grinding the same content with the same cookie-cutter builds.\n\nThere are so many lessons that should have been learned from the first Path of Exile and even the early struggles of Diablo 4, but somehow they went ignored. The fact that the game was launched into early access in this state does not inspire confidence that updates will fix it enough to make it enjoyable.\n\nThe lack of quality-of-life features and polish already makes it hard to imagine coming back, even after updates.

The slower-paced, tactical combat shines with its emphasis on chaining skill combos, making each encounter feel deliberate and rewarding. It\u2019s a refreshing change of pace, encouraging experimentation and strategic thinking, which I thoroughly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game undergoes a significant shift in the endgame. The intricate combos that define the campaign are largely abandoned in favor of fast-paced, high-damage, clear-speed-focused skills. This transition feels jarring, as the endgame philosophy diverges from what the campaign teaches you. The tactical, deliberate playstyle gives way to a more chaotic approach, which may alienate players who fall in love with the campaign\u2019s rhythm.\r\n\r\nCrafting, another hallmark of Path of Exile\u2019s identity, also feels underwhelming in its current state. With exalted orbs dropping sparingly, crafting your own equipment is often overshadowed by the convenience of trading for what you need. While trading has always been integral to the Path of Exile experience, the diminished rewards of crafting leave a gap for those who enjoy creating custom gear.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that this review reflects the early access state of Path of Exile 2, and changes are likely as the game continues to evolve. Balancing the campaign and endgame experience, as well as refining the crafting system, could significantly enhance the overall experience. For now, the campaign is a tactical joy, but the endgame leaves room for improvement.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re diving in early, expect a captivating journey and some bumps on the road to the endgame. Time will tell if Path of Exile 2 can truly harmonize its parts into a cohesive whole.", "timestamp_created": 1735018374, "timestamp_updated": 1735018374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

For example, in PoE 1, many vendors had \"secret recipes\", which only led to everyone looking up the information on the wiki. Information being gatekept in such a way was bad and removing it from PoE 2 is a good thing. They've removed portal scrolls and just given you the ability to warp at any time back to town, for example. \r\n-They straight-up added a currency exchange that players use to trade with other players automatically. Simply put your buy/sell order up with the NPC that has this option and it will work by itself.\r\n-Trading is as easy as ever, although sometimes it also feels like it's simply a better option than working with the drops you have to make a good item. \r\n-Boss fights throughout the story mode are fun and engaging. I felt accomplished when beating most of them.\r\n-It feels like you have way more access to stronger builds, as skill gems have been removed from equipment and simply given their own system/tab. You now add skills to your open slots and add \"support gems\" to those skills to amplify them in various ways. Creating different builds is WAY more accessible with this new system, in my opinion.\r\n-The developers porting basically everything you bought in PoE 1 to PoE 2 for free is a chad move. There are several cosmetics from PoE 1 which aren't added at this time, but the indication is that they will be later. However, all of my stash tabs that I had purchased in PoE 1 were there for me in PoE 2 on Day 1.\r\n\r\nCONS (NOTE: A lot of these were talked about during the developers' latest Steam post. We'll see if these improve.)\r\n-Dodge roll mechanic is clunky at best and un-usable at worst.\r\n-Post-death effects on monsters, which have the potential to one-shot a lot of characters, is not good game design. There's one thing to be said for learning monster affixes, etc., but it is not fun for my first instinct to be to wait 5 seconds after killing an Elite to ensure it doesn't explode a few seconds after dying.\r\n-Maps feel like they are 25-33% too big throughout the game. There are checkpoints throughout the \"story\", but no checkpoints when you are doing endgame mapping. Having to backtrack across an already oversized map without the ability to simply quick-jump to a checkpoint feels ..bad. To be honest, the big maps wouldn't be that big of a deal to me personally if they added the ability to warp to checkpoints you've unlocked for that map.\r\n-Map design for endgame mapping is stale and feels underdeveloped. For a lot of the maps, there just doesn't feel like a lot of personality to it compared to the endgame mapping in PoE 1. I am hoping this improves throughout EA.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Good game with a lot of content available which needs more polish throughout Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1735013932, "timestamp_updated": 1735013932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183536966": {"recommendationid": "183536966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375335809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3254, "playtime_at_review": 4510, "last_played": 1735057428}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks good / feels good - Great ARPG", "timestamp_created": 1735013823, "timestamp_updated": 1735013823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183536926": {"recommendationid": "183536926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019389079", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 6913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4422, "playtime_at_review": 6907, "last_played": 1735015737}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent game but I would wait for full release to play it for free with all of the content.

Currently we're all playing standard during EA, lots of nerfs and buffs to come.\n\n[h1]A Natural Evolution to Path of Exile 1[/h1]\n\n[h2][b]The Good[/b][/h2]\n[b]Graphics, Visual, Game Environments[/b]\nGGG absolutely nailed this one. The character animations, movement all feels lightyears ahead of where PoE 1 left off. There's a specific feeling that is tough to describe that really lets you feel the character you're playing as. The aggressive speed of getting bow shots off with the Deadeye, the impact from a strike with a monk, and the recoil of something like a grenade launcher. It all plays together so well to give each weapon type a uniqueness.\n\nThe environment and music of this game are beautiful. Act 3 especially had me wandering the tilesets to see all the little details and the beautiful color choices that signify the Vaal. The added cutscenes between acts help build and establish the world and truly give you the feeling like you're an exile within this world.\n\n[b]Game Speed, Pace, and Difficulty[/b]\nThese all receive top marks with some caveats, we'll get into them in the categories below. If you went into this game, or are going in expecting to blast through maps as fast as PoE, then you're going to be disappointed. But don't let that deter you. Yes you won't be running around, character model filling the screen finishing maps in 30 seconds, but the pacing feels wonderful for what's available at end-game mapping. Density gets better as you progress through the tiers.\n\nGame pace and difficulty. I LOVED the difficulty of the campaign for your first character. I will say that I believe some of that difficulty is purely due to certain dev decisions, like not allowing you to level your gems and abilities beyond specific levels due to how gemcutting is gated behind zone levels. Your first character will probably take some time to get through campaign and to gear. Once you've made it into end-game, alts will be much easier to level and faster too, but on initial impression, the game was challening, bosses felt amazing to learn and then defeat.\n\n[h2][b]The Alrights[/b][/h2]\n[b]Itemization and Crafting[/b]\nI don't miss the days of running between my crafting bench, slamming, reusing the crafting bench to remove mods, and block prefix/suffix. What a hassle, but I do miss the ability to at least place one selected mod within a range that I want. Even if the tiers are low, this at least helps with some of the itemization issues people face during their campaign playthrough. \n\nSlamming with exalts really loses it's luster when you have a fairly decent potential upgrade and you slam and get +30 accuracy. You can rain down exalts on the player base, but with no options to really control the craft, you leave it up to dumb luck, and the weightings for good mods aren't very likely to hit. \n\nOf course, the loot chase, the perfect items, chase items, these are all core to the ARPG experience, but I wish there were options to play around in that middle tiering of gear before you start to finalize and min-max for farming or pinnacles. \n\n[b]Weapon Bases[/b]\nJust putting this down, but as of this writing we are missing swords, claws, flails, primals and axes, so itemization is a bit on the lower end for weapons.

Most of your character power comes from your equipment. The huge skill tree is useless if you don't get lucky with your gear. If you think that shouldn't be a problem, you should also know that the droprates are absolutely horrendous. People will increase their drop rate by 100% and that's barely tolerable, if you get a godly 400% drop rate increase you might finally see the drop rate you would expect.\nNever once have I gotten a unique that is worth anything (including tier XV map farming). All the gear I have ever used I have either made, gambled for, or bought from other people for exorbitant amounts of money.\nOh, by the way, the market became absolute ass with sky-high prices within days of release. I think you can expect the same thing to happen every time a new league launches. This makes it impossible to buy build-enabling uniques, as the price immediately skyrockets as soon as a build is released or updated.\nSo, either you don't have good gear and everything is unimaginably hard, or you have good gear and everything dies in an instant.\n\nThe map design is dull and forgettable. Everything is a giant maze filled with mob packs, a few secret stashes and like 3(?) hidden bosses.\n\nThe endgame, which you reach after beating the game twice and being forced to go through the same old giant mazes again, consists of endlessly clearing maps to get more currency and buy better gear, all of which will be forgotten forever in an early access standard league that is separate from the normal standard leagues.\nThere is simply no motivation to keep farming in the endgame.\nThere is also very little motivation to level a new character to maps, because that would mean clearing the boring giant maze maps again... TWICE.\nYou might ask why, if I dislike the idea of levelling a second character, did I do it anyway? Well, it's because the functionality of the build I was going for was nerfed to the point where it could be considered removed from the game altogether, as it became completely unviable.\nSo I was forced to create a new character in hopes that the build I was going for wouldn't get nerfed.\nAs a result of that patch the build had incredible difficulty with clearing trash mobs, but would delete bosses in seconds. Shouldn't balancing be done with a goal completely opposite to that?\n\nYou could tell me to play my own build and thus have a better chance of avoiding the nerfs and price gouging on parts of popular builds, but chances are your custom build will not get you to maps due to the aforementioned horribly designed difficulty, or you would spend way more time leveling which in of itself holds no reward.\nIf you would recommend that I should just git gud, I would kindly refer you to my list of games with all achievements.\n\nWith a forgettable story, poor difficulty design, and obnoxiously large maps that you have to clear twice to get to the endgame, this game in its current state is a time sink that does not adequately reward you for the time you put into it.\n\nPath of Exile was much easier and much less accessible in its design. Path of Exile 2 for all its improvements to the PoE formula, went way overboard with difficulty, making it less accessible in the end anyway.\n\nI'm looking forward to all the improvements that GGG can cook up during the game's development and I sincerely hope to change this review once the game becomes better for everyone.\n\nStill better than Diablo IV.", "timestamp_created": 1735010791, "timestamp_updated": 1735011459, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528688490390777588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183534378": {"recommendationid": "183534378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176196194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 839, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1735027651}, "language": "english", "review": "after the latest update, game fps drop 50%. it was 80 now 40", "timestamp_created": 1735010750, "timestamp_updated": 1735010750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183534361": {"recommendationid": "183534361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087868833", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3256, "playtime_at_review": 3024, "last_played": 1735036539}, "language": "english", "review": "Most fun I have had in a video game in a long time.

Gearing is slow you need to trade using a website to get gear tailored for your build if you want to optimise. Once you have a strong build you can clear the game easy and now it's time for endgame.

The map is gone so you have to use the site for a tier 15 if you don't want to grind all the way up again or if you were lucky to get a tier 10-14 but the drop rate is abysmal.

Crafting is also terrible which makes a lot of drops basically \"almost\" worth a crap, but ultimately 99% arent. Not to mention they kept the same rippy gameplay in red maps where an on death effect will one shot your max res 3k life 74% armor 72% evasion character and you couldnt see it because of on screen effects. This wouldnt be such a big deal but in their infinite wisdom they made maps a one shot event. I love poe and poe2 could honestly be amazing... one day, but that day isnt this one and I am honestly disappointed they took lessons learned from poe1 and then put the same issues back into this one. A lot of people will defend it with early access, but early access is no reason to bring issues we knew about 6 years ago and putting them back in the game just to likely \"fix\" them again later. If this was a different dev and this was their first foray into the ARPG genre I would give this an 8 and say it has a ton of potential, but this is GGG and they honestly know better.

But as a fan of PoE1 (not a Pro, yet 150hrs) I think I'm experienced enough and bored enough now to write this review. \n\nTL;DR\nI understand that many people will love the game. Unlike me, many people love Dark Souls, Wukong, Sekiro and those types of games. Also \"git gud\", \"n00b\", \"cry more\", \"did you even tried\", I know, I know. However, I somehow expected a better version of PoE 1. More understandable, with progressive difficulty and huge possibilities in making different builds. \n\nWhat I got is a top-down Souls-like game where the most important mechanic is \"rolling like a pr*ck on the floor\", with bottleneck Boss fights forcing you to grind experience (and with not many places where you can get it), and zero tolerance for making a different build than a power-gamer one - there is often one specific skill you basically have to use to kill the boss.\n\nI read the dev's notes, and I think they probably will tweak it, they will balance it, they will listen to players, they will add a huge amount of content later and it probably will be good after all. But for me, sadly, not in this state. \n---\n\nWanna read more random thoughts?  \n\nOkay. First things first: the developers were awesome during PoE1 time. I gladly voluntarily paid about an AAA game price in PoE just for some cosmetics, simply to support a great game. I have to say it again: it was a FREE game, and probably the best one for me. \nPoE 2 on the other hand is \"free-to-play, but pay 27 Eur or more if you want to play now\" game. Which I kinda get, the price seems fair, but let's be honest, it's not really a free to play, is it. It is benefiting from a huge hype the game got. It may be free later, but for now, the feeling of wanting to support the devs is out, at least for me. Now it is a paying customer-developer relationship. So no reason to be a Mr. f*ing nice guy anymore. :) \n\nI'm sorry to say this is worse than the first Path of Exile, which I absolutely loved for many years. The first game was a great Diablo-like clone, where you had enormous possibilities thanks to the huge skill tree and you could make basically unlimited number of character builds. PoE was a game built on experimenting. You never felt trapped in a story, you never felt overpowered, you just had to find a way or change your character a bit to go through a difficult stage (of course, the end game is a different story). You also often had an opportunity to choose from several maps, so even the levelling up almost never felt \"grindy\". \n\nThe PoE2 feels VERY different from PoE1, like a completely different game. Harder is ok, but this is more frustrating than fun. You can't make a mistake in your skill tree, every choice you make in your build feels permanent, there is no space for experiments, at least at the beginning. \n\nThis may not the problem of all characters or if you are not solo-ing, but there seems to be many bottlenecks in the form of a Boss - you can't continue unless you beat the boss. The problem is, that many times you don't have a proper gear (didn't drop, still have the gear from Act 1), you can't really improve it much as there is not enough stones and gold dropping (never ever bought a \"random\" item as it costs thousands) and when entering the fight, you are almost always at least 1 or 2 levels below the proper chance to beat the boss. That means you have to grind a level. However, there is nowhere to grind. If you clear the whole map including small bosses on the map where your unbeatable boss is, you get approx. 3 slots out of 20 on your level progress. If you clear the whole map including big boss a map before, you get about 1 slot out of 20. So you clear one map again and again to get that one level that will hopefully make the difference in a Boss fight, otherwise you are stuck between the Boss and the maps you get nothing out of. \n\nThis may be subjective, but items drop seems wild. First 20 levels I got average items at best, then I got 3 legendary (orange) in one minute out of 2 small bosses. None of them for my character, of course. :) \n\nThere are some improvements. I like the spell & support system, also the gold as main currency, there is much fewer confusing things for newbies (PoE 1 was overwhelming sometimes with all the currencies and gems and so on..)... However the gameplay screams \"let's make it artificially hard\" everywhere. E.g. the flask system: flasks drops all the time, yet 95% of flask are useless, as you can't trade them for better ones as in PoE1 (you can sell them for a few coins). This means you have ONE health flask and ONE mana flask at the beginning as you enter the boss fight with about 7 heals, while most bosses can almost one-shot you in a 10 minutes fight of perfect dodging and continuous damage uptime.\n\nThis review is VERY subjective. I may be wrong about many things. Some things may change later in a game. Or later during the development. Also I'm old and nowhere near to be as good at games as 20 years before (however I'm probably not alone, just look at literally thousands of \"thank you, I tried it for a week\" comments in some \"how to cheat a Boss\" guides on YouTube ). I  don't want to be unfair. But right now (end of 2024), I can't help myself: \n\nI was really looking for PoE2 and hoping for the better, nicer version of PoE1 minus the things players hated on PoE, but the truth is I don't have a fraction of fun I got in PoE 1.", "timestamp_created": 1735006917, "timestamp_updated": 1735010040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593265771865844727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183530954": {"recommendationid": "183530954", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013870491", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11022, "playtime_at_review": 12044, "last_played": 1735056869}, "language": "english", "review": "Great trading simulator.

I fought with her like 10 times because she was spamming 1 skill all the time! One little mistake there and you are dead >_<.\nAlso some bosses can use some skills during fight that it's impossible to dodge, for example fight with Doryani... lighting cupola that makes inside lightining dmg and outside makes little lightining on the ground, ice laser that makes ground with ice which makes you obviooously slow and of coooourse gives you dmg and then he is turning around with lasers that gives you tones of dmg, impossible to dodge >_< there is nowhere to hide because all the time there is this lighting cupole, rolling doesn't work.\nI recommend buuut it's pretty easy to get tired and annoyed of this game. >_<", "timestamp_created": 1735001296, "timestamp_updated": 1735033469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183526116": {"recommendationid": "183526116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002590535", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2080, "playtime_at_review": 2013, "last_played": 1735018329}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, minor goofy issues that will probably get worked out by full launch.

Once you get to act 4-6 and the endgame content stuff starts to get very difficult and wonky.\r\n\r\nThe endgame content as a Ranger feels like I'm gambling at every second. If I'm not able to immediately kill things then they can just run up to me and 1 shot me even if I have 60%+ in resistances and 78% evasion with \"Acrobatics\" which allows you to evade all \"Hits\" which include AoE spells and effects. If you die at all in the end game system called Maps then you lose your ability to go back to that map and complete it. This means that any 1 shot from a non rare or non magic enemy that hits you effectively wipes the run and any drops that are on the ground or events that have yet to be completed are just gone because you can't go back.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? It means that you spend 80% of your time in the end game trying to trade for better gear because people dont answer their whispers or they just list stuff to see how many whispers they get so they can re-list the item for even more divine orbs. Divine Orbs dont drop. I have 200% or so increased rarity of items found and I have only had maybe 4 divine orbs drop in the 133 hours I have played. All of the good gear is locked behind Divine Orb trading and none of it is acquirable unless you were one of the several thousand that have knowledge of POE1 and knew that Divine Orbs were going to be increasing in value and bought as many as you could in the beginning weeks of the game.\r\n\r\nIt's week 4 now, Everything on the market is either 1 exalt (if it's a trash item not being used in a build) or 1-200 divine orbs (If it is a common item used in a good build). In standard league, you have a lot of stormweavers... why is that? Because they are effectively unable to die if they kill everything off screen with a super juiced spark Skill gem. There are some really effective builds but most of them require buying most of your gear from the market, which brings me back to everything on the market is too expensive. Increased rarity of items found seems to do literally nothing in maps 7-13 but from what I've seen running tier 15 maps is the best way to get divines. Stormweavers can pump their max mana, damage recouped as mana, and then using a specific passive can make it so all damage they get is reduced from mana instead of life. This is busted in my opinion. At least it should be given that the rest of the classes except for Titan warrior have a hard time stacking HP to reach the same effectiveness. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have is that I am not interested in playing another class until they release more content... Right now I feel like I hit a wall and nothing I do will stop random unnamed non-magic non-rare enemies from one shotting me if they land that 22% chance to hit me. Why does my life flask restore health if every hit one shots at map tiers 10+. I've lost all interest in trying to progress. I havent even seen the end game bosses yet because you need so much currency to even go to the boss arena and the 4th trial of ascendancy is absolutely bonkers in the 1 shot category as well.

At a high level:\r\n\r\nCampaign: 10/10 - really fantastic first few acts. Great story, great game play, bosses are fun and not just slam a button. Monster diversity of types is outstanding - you constantly feel like you are fighting new mobs. Drops and progression flows well.\r\n\r\nEarly end-game - Fun, but can be very confusing as so much is tossed at you at once. If you haven't played poe1 you might be confused and quit.\r\n\r\nEnd game: Some real issues here. Boring for starters.

So, to clarify, this review is going to be focused around end game and not the campaign, which I thought was phenomenal. \n\nThe real issues for me right now with the game are primarily inside of 3 categories: end game, melee combat, and economy. \n\nEnd game feels like it could be it's own entirely separate title, and I mean that in the negative sense. Imagine running on a treadmill and steadily increasing your incline and speed and then suddenly having it doubled instantly and your stamina halved. No joke, that's what going from the end of act 3 brutal to mapping in end game feels like. It comes out of nowhere, explains itself poorly, suddenly expects you to be ready to die at a moments notice because you're now made out of tissue paper, be punished for dying (silly you for not knowing what you weren't told), and worst of all follow extremely cheesy builds that have you, wait for it, BLOWING UP SCREENS OF ENEMIES just like POE1 so you can survive and thrive. WOW, I thought this was POE2 not POE2.0 \n\nIt's so abrupt, so stark compared to the measured and tactical combat in the campaign, it throws you WAY OFF. Suddenly over half of your skills/spells and supports are worthless and the only ones that ARE worth taking are the big ones that go boom across your monitor. What's worse? The veteran POE playerbase is totally ok with this eye melting doo doo because that's what they're used to playing. Again, I didn't realize we were all playing POE2.0 here. GGG is going to need to evaluate end game an decide if they want the weighted and souls-like combat to carry over from the campaign to end game, or just running with this frankenstein copy paste poe1 end game format they sloppily put in EA. \n\nI invested in this game because I didn't want to have to follow build guides, engage in convoluted mechanic bloat, and constrain myself to only a few playstyles because nothing else works well. I thought POE2 was about accessibility and flexibility, but so far i've felt none of that since the end of the campaign. \n\nMelee combat for example just feels awful due to the way end game maps are designed. Going toe-to-toe with any enemy on even a semi-juiced map can mean certain death on a character that was doing really well face tanking the rest of the game in the levels leading up to end game. Now you're expected to either play from distance or invest heavily in screen wide explosive power to survive, basically invalidating 3/4 of your skills. This is clearly bad by design and needs addressing. There is such a world where a power fantasy of destroying packs of monsters can feel good without resorting to playing a hit and run nuke playstyle. If I want that i'll play a sorc. \n\nThe real kicker here though is the economy and how easily it's gotten out of control because of silly ass gear traits like \"rarity\" stacking being so powerful + running in groups basically showering you with loot. This is already leading to inflation and making it so that early map players looking to purchase decently rolled gear just to survive the hellscape end game system are being gatekept behind the need for precious resources like divine orbs just to buy the gear that enables these over-the-top builds allowing them to be peformant enough to tackle anything more than tier 5 maps. And you know it's not just me when RMT game accounts are randomly whispering people about orb sales. Clearly there's some serious manipulation going on and it's downright disgusting. \n\nWhat's this mean for a SSF player like myself? Well, because the drop rates are so totally shit i'm forced to run rarity on my gear instead of damage that I would have otherwise preferred. And because I don't find much of that gear due to the bad drop rates and the crafting system being mostly gambling garbage, i'm forced to engage with the janky trade site to even begin bringing a build online. It really makes me wonder who this game is being aimed at exactly. Why can't I have targeted farming? Or no rarity on gear but instead as a prefix/suffix on waystones and tablets or through specific game modes? This forced scarcity through a single junky stat on gear is a real bad habit of old game devs and it needs to go. Magic find is lazy game design. You're basically telling me: don't build a powerful character and reach the higher difficulty tiers on maps to earn better rewards, but instead just stack rarity and get the same amount/quality of loot on easy maps with no work. This is just bad for obvious reasons and will only get worse the longer it goes on. \n\nAnyway, I only write at length here because I do care and I really do hope GGG can take action to make the end game feel just as amazing as the campaign did for me. I know they have it in them, they're very talented dudes and I have faith in their commitment to make something genuinely new and not just a 2.0 version of the first game.

There are plenty of problems that this game needs to sift through before full release, but its still an incredibly rewarding experience getting through some of the content.\n\nThe Pros.... include things like the more engaging combat, the great looking skills, the cool story and Boss fights....(especially the boss fights.) Controller even feels great in this game! Dual Stick shooter style has been how i play most of the time while i vomit lightning upon everything. (The controller UI still needs quite a bit of work like not being able to set prices correctly)\n\nThe Cons..... are pretty big cons right now.\nIncredibly awful loot tables still for gear. You are FORCED to use the poe trade site when you hit a wall. The only other option is to grind out areas you have already beaten...over...and over...and over again. hoping for a single piece of gear that can help. if you didnt want to use the trade site? too bad.\n\nAscendancy points are locked behind RNG trials that require an item to rng drop. One trial gives you an extra health bar to manage while throwing pretty unreasonable afflictions at you through 3 floors of multiroom trials. The other is just way overtuned and has a preferred \"path\" laid out by the community. Includes having to go through animations of levers, or placing objects while monsters seem to infinitely spawn.\nYes. They are beatable and quite the challenge. However i think too much for a lot of players.\n\nEndgame. Mapping in the Atlas has some pretty enjoyable parts to it. I like the way its all laid out. Extremely cool. This is going to be where a lot of players spend time and it shows they have been working hard on the content........\n...........However....... having my first T6 map drop, only to get into the map and have servers straight up freeze completely on me, kick me to title screen with an \"unexpected disconnection\" (all my other internet still working fine btw)..... I load back in and portals are gone, map has been eaten. WELP..... back to grinding maps so another one hopefully drops OR grind out some gold to buy a bunch of tier 1 maps(5k gold per (t1 x 3) to make a t2 so this is about 350-400k gold per t6) to combine into t2>t3>t4>t5>t6. it gets costly.\n\nIm assuming this will all get worked out and get better over time. Im actually kind of heart broken to say im 50/50 on recommending what i think will be a great game. Its just in a rough spot right now.

IF you aren't sure about having WASD in an ARPG, holy crap does it change SO much in a wonderful way. IF you're ok with skipping end game and making tons of builds to mess around, buy now. IF you want an ARPG that ramps up the difficulty and can be genuinely challenging, this is worth. IF you loved POE 1 and for some bizarre reason haven't bought this already...I'm assuming you have real life constraints and are reading reviews to torture yourself. I won't kink shame.  \r\n\r\n[b]Reasons to wait[/b] If you want a game that is polished enough for you to get FAR into end game w/o losing tons of progress, probably wait. If you remember ascendancy trials from POE 1 and don't want something 10X harder, then AVOID. If you're a casual gamer putting in a few hours a day who wants a ray of hope that you can complete your build, I'd hesitate. \r\n\r\n(If you want to play a game where parts or all of your build don't get frequently nerfed...my fellow human, why would you EVER play a game by GGG?)\r\n\r\n[b]Genuine waste of my life[/b]: The honor mechanic is bullsh*t, especially when there are invisible things that can one shot you even with 75% honor resistance. I have been at full honor on the third floor, only to die from something on the ground that I cannot see. I'm talking about ~5k insta-killed by some sh*t in the sand that is invisible. One enemy somewhere on the edge of the screen puts something on the ground and BLAM! \r\n\r\nI've played for 85 hours, easily 12 of which have been dying somewhere on the third floor of the third ascendancy. I'm not rage quitting, I'm practicing depression avoidance. Because to try again would require an unhealthy amount of liquor. I'm genuinely sad to stop playing, because as a life long gamer there is SO much good to be said about this game, even at early access. \r\n\r\nTBC: The end game isn't great, but I'd still be playing. Sure, GGG nerfed the crap out multiple things I was playing around with. After minor rage over their fun blocking, I changed my builds and continued on. That's part of the cycle of gaming, [i]especially[/i] in early access. But the trials are, for me, impossible after the first two because of GRAPHICS that hide ground effects. There are some other graphical issues I might raise, but so many deaths wiping hours of progress is what did me in. \r\n\r\nIf you somehow read this far, many thanks and happy gaming whatever you play!", "timestamp_created": 1734992216, "timestamp_updated": 1734992216, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496982604265213013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183517106": {"recommendationid": "183517106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065082319", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7931, "playtime_at_review": 9933, "last_played": 1735057367}, "language": "english", "review": "If POE was what Diablo 3 should have been, this one is what Diablo IV should be.", "timestamp_created": 1734992200, "timestamp_updated": 1734992200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183517011": {"recommendationid": "183517011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980165552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1706, "playtime_at_review": 2175, "last_played": 1735014274}, "language": "english", "review": "Has some issues that are probably easy fixes but besides that a great ARPG with a lot of complexity", "timestamp_created": 1734992115, "timestamp_updated": 1734992115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183516957": {"recommendationid": "183516957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209073903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1382, "playtime_at_review": 3239, "last_played": 1734984383}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so addicting!

Honestly I feel like any build is viable. Its nice to see you can literally make any character you want. Want to have a necromancer with a Two handed Maul. GO for it. I wouldnt recommend it but I wouldnt definitely play it hahaha. The skill tree is soooo expansive its almost jarring how big it is at first. You might feel lost at first playing the game. I feel the game does a good job of slowly easing a newer player to the poe universe into the game. Act 1 felt extremely slow but once I got past it and started in act 2. I suddenly realized the genius of it all. \n\nI think it was meant to be that way so you get used to hit boxes and dodge timing and skill chaining. At least for me that map made it very easy to figure those things out. The map you start off in, In Act 1 feels nice and spacious. Your not confined and because of that you have free reign to figure out how to fight. Then you get to that little mini boss in the middle. and it throws you into a ring where you have to figure out how to dodge in a small area. The more I think about it, the better I think act 1 was for new players. \n\nBut this is alll coming from a completely new player of poe.\n\nI love the game to say the least and I had never played the first poe.\n\nIn early access its fairly easy to say this game is miles better then Diablo 4 its not even a contest.

I can go on all day, Best part about this game is the graphics, the boss design and the story, all of these are  A+ s Tier but the bosses are hit or miss, Im stuck at a boss that has 2 bosses at once, 1 boss is mele with range skills the other is a Mage that can hit me 3 times and kill me with shifting spells, the Mele boss  can 1 shot me with his range abilitys and 2 shot me with the mele ones, Defence is incredibly hard to build early game because of the lack of drops on currency and decent gear, the vendors Sell CRAP gear idk how players say they sell good stuff??? WHERE IS THIS GOOD GEAR??? its all white blue gear???

you are gonna  use to buy even more gear for yourself  only to realise that noones buying your items and you have no way to make actual valid upgrades.Game was advertised about its complex endgame and

Much like our environment has been corrupted by the unchecked forces of industry, so too has the gaming landscape been tainted by games that prioritize profit over passion. Until now.\r\n\r\nPath of Exile 2 emerges as a beacon of hope, a return to the roots where gameplay reigns supreme, not unlike the way we must return to our natural roots for true health and sustainability. This game, developed by Grinding Gear Games, is no mere sequel; it's a revolution in the realm of action RPGs, much like the one we need in our society for transparency and autonomy.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the core - the combat. Unlike Diablo 4, which has succumbed to the banalities of mainstream design, favoring a sanitized, crowd-pleasing approach, Path of Exile 2 insists on a combat system that demands your full engagement. It's slower, yes, but deliberate, much like our need to slow down from the frenetic pace of modern life to truly appreciate what's in front of us. Here, each swing of your sword, each cast of your spell, carries weight; it's an experience that echoes the meticulous care we should take with our environment. You're not just clicking through enemies; you're strategizing, adapting, learning - a true test of your skill and patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the customization - the freedom to mold your character into something uniquely your own. This isn't about microtransactions or pushing you towards a one-size-fits-all gameplay style. No, this is about crafting your own destiny, much like we must take control of our personal health and not rely on the pharmaceutical giants dictating our choices. The skill tree in Path of Exile 2 is vast and intricate, a testament to player autonomy, something we desperately need in more aspects of our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Path of Exile 2 is not just a narrative; it's an experience, woven with threads of darkness and redemption, much like the stories we need to hear in our real world to remind us of our capacity for change and growth. While Diablo 4 might dazzle with its polish, it lacks the soul, the raw storytelling that connects you to the world of Wraeclast in a way that feels real, feels human.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Diablo 4's often overwhelming loot system, Path of Exile 2 respects your time and intelligence by providing loot that matters, where every drop can lead to a significant upgrade or a new strategy. This is not about flooding you with meaningless gear but about quality and impact, akin to how we should approach resource management in our world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, the bosses in Path of Exile 2 are not just enemies; they are challenges, learning experiences. They demand respect, preparation, and skill - something I wish our political and corporate leaders would embody. Each encounter is memorable, forcing you to adapt, much like we must adapt to the challenges our society faces.\r\n\r\nIn essence, Path of Exile 2 isn't just better than Diablo 4; it's a game that champions the values of depth, authenticity, and personal engagement over superficiality and mass appeal. It's a game for those who seek truth, challenge, and a narrative that resonates with our struggle for autonomy in an increasingly controlled world. Here, in Wraeclast, we find not just entertainment, but a reflection of the fight for integrity in our own lives. Play this game not just for the thrill, but for the lesson in resilience, creativity, and the power of individual choice.

I have been having an absolute blast, though there are some drawbacks. I had the assumption that POE2 would make Diablo 4 all but dead, but that isn't the case. There are a LOT of quality of life decisions that Diablo 4 has made that still in my opinion make it the superior ARPG. \r\n\r\nThe lack of QOL things in POE2 is astounding. I will name a few off the top of my head:\r\n1. Scrolls of Wisdom: requiring players to identify items before they can see the stats is utterly pointless, Diablo 4 proved this after removing all identification mechanics from the game. Don't waste my time have to click on a NPC to identify my items before I begin sorting the trash out.\r\n\r\n2. Partying and grouping: lots of stuff here is missing starting with the feeling of wanting to group with friends. In D4 I played with about 6 people consistently, we were ALWAYS in groups together. I'm level 83 right now and I have not grouped with anyone except to kill like 3 low level bosses my friends couldn't kill. \r\nGroup looting.... with the way group looting functions I don't really want to group with friends because then we will have to properly split the loot up so one of us isn't getting 0 loot. All loot that drops is available for anyone in the party to pick up. Diablo 4 solved this issue and many other ARPGs along with it with personal loot. The loot that drops is only able to be picked up by me and if I want to give it to a friend, I can. This is the better group looting scenario by all aspects. If a divine orb drops and I get all excited to see it drop, but then my buddy grabs it first or we have to spend time splitting it up evenly with exalts, thats just additional time wasted.\r\n\r\nA big QOL mechanic in D4 is I only receive loot for my class. Need I say more? Most loot I get in POE2 I just sell it off and buy the gear I want. I don't think I have worn a single item that I have received as a drop. I understand crafting is a big aspect to getting gear you can use, but I don't like crafting at all in any game, period.\r\n\r\nI love necromancers, the POE1 necromancer was likely my favorite necro in all ARPGs... I do not like the spirit system and having to reserve and have a certain amount of spirit to be able to have a permanent minion, then if u want certain curses or such, that also reserves spirit so you have to split your spirit between minions and skills that may reserve spirit.... As a necromancer I just want to have like 30+ \"PERMANENT\" minions and watch them wreck things. That brings up the very temporrary minions like raging spirits and zombies and undearth... whoever thought temporary minon satisfy my hunger for having a lot of minions following me around made a bad assumption. I don't want to have to consistently cast flamewall to summons my SRS or any skill to continuously summon my temporary minions for a few seconds and then do it all over again. I just want permanent minions, and more than say 10-15.. I want like 30-80.... \r\n\r\nThe incessantly long campaign that took me 60 hours to do was a large part of why i didnt play with friends... just like in D4 where we didnt really play together during the campaign because we wanted to experience the story is the same here but D4s campaign was around 12-15 hours or so and that is acceptable. After beating the campaign with 1 character you can skip it with any following characters, WHAT A HUGE QOL feature so I can make new characters and IMMEDIATELY start playing with my friends. I don't really want to experience a 60 hours campaign with my friends that would require us to consistently play at the same time so neither of us fall behind... \r\n\r\nI dunno, there is just a LOT of QOL features missing here and I hope they bring a lot to the table on release. \r\nAlso, hitboxes for certain menu things like right clicking a party member to trade with your or invite to party... get those hit boxes bigger!!! If your mouse isnt in the right spot on the word trade or invite then it doesn't click, I should be able to click on the very edge of a button in the UI and it click, period.", "timestamp_created": 1734982796, "timestamp_updated": 1734982796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183505891": {"recommendationid": "183505891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004922364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1556, "playtime_at_review": 1464, "last_played": 1735029052}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

So here's my review :\n\n[h2] The Good : [/h2]\n\n- Stunning environement and SFX. Everything truly looks good.\n\n- 90% of bosses are really fun to fight.\n\n- Killing mobs feels really good with most skills. Comet shattering packs, shock sfx on bodies afterward, etc.\n\n- Amazing soundtrack as usual.\n\n- Meeting character like Doryani & Balbala is awesome after hearing so much about them in poe1.\n\n- The campaign map is pretty good, seeing boss kills permanent bonuses is helpful.\n\n- The atlas map looks cute.\n\n- Vaaling is more fun, as the risk is inherently lower than in poe1.\n\n- The weapon swap system is a brilliant idea, aside from the slight delay when swapping weapons.\n\n- Pausing\n\n- WASD movement is incredible.\n\n[h2] The Bad [/h2]\n\n- On-death effects are exhausting. I say that as a spark spellweaver, with a massive ehp pool and CI , so I can facetank all on-death without issue. I can't imagine what people playing life-based char are feeling right now.\n\n- Mobs' speed is frustrating. I feel like deleting whole screens at once is the best way to survive because you WILL meet a pack of hasted rare that WILL bodyblock and stunlock you to oblivion.\n\n- Combat was advertised as methodical. It isn't after like act 3. Mobs are no different from poe1 while most builds are stuck at poe2 powerlevel.\n\n- Ascending isn't very fun. I'm glad I crushed all trials with CoC comet before it got destroyed. \"Sanctum\" is blatantly unfair to some builds, while Ultimatum is absurdly overtuned. The biggest issue is that both of those are so full of RNG from afflictions / mods. I can't believe this is worse than lab.\n\n- The gem system is strangely restrictive. Most spells and support aren't available until very late in Cruel. 6L are very expensive for casual players, and discourage experimentation since they're linked to a single gem.\n\n[h2] The Ugly [/h2]\n\n- Mapping\n\n- Horrible map layouts being forced on players. I feel that not being able to set-up a 50 maps farming session, with a good tileset is 60%+ of the reason why poe2 mapping is so exhausting.\n\n- Augury and Myre. Maps need to be shortened by at least 50%, and add a boss to every map.\n\n- Backtracking for a single rare. Having to kill every rare.\n\n- Towers feel like a complete waste of time. They should either be \"open\" whenever an adjacent map is completed, or be a single boss fight room. Imagine being forced to run a Pillars of Arun in poe1 everytime you want to use a sextant.\n\n- Having to scrolls for 40s in the new atlas. No search bar, no way to zoom out to see everything in graph form.\n\n- Atlas skill points being locked behind their respective boss fight. Why ? It feels awful. You're forced to gamble on an expensive invitation 4 times to not lose currency. With 1 portal. You should simply have to complete league encounters in higher and higher tiers maps...\n\n- MF returning is 100% a mistake, especially in its current form, affecting currency as well as item drops. Poe1 finally (partially) excised that tumor in 3.25 by removing quant. Please do the same. I won't launch into a 50k word manifesto on MF and its numerous shitty side effects, other people have already done it on this sub.\n\n- 1 portal for pinnacle bosses is absurd. I don't care about bosses being fully healed after 1 death, but ONE try, for an unknow boss with requires hours to farm? Come on.\n\n- The Arbiter fight needs fixing. Sometimes you can't avoid death without a weaponswap blink. As usual , the best way deal with this is just to delete him before he does anything.\n\n- Crafting\n\n- Slamming orbs while closing your eyes is gambling, not crafting. 99% of players are priced out of targeting omens so the crafting system is just a wisdom scroll with extra steps. Fractured items should be reintroduced asap.\n\n- Greater Essences are far too rare.\n\n- Targeting omens are far too rare.\n\n- Build balancing. I'm sad that GGG is back to their old way of deleting builds rather than taking the time to balance them (CoC, CoF..). I think it's very telling that the most popular builds are those that play the most like poe1 (spark, gaz arrow deadeye, LA deadeye). 1 button, screen clear builds. I'm convince that if GGG makes builds like those unplayable, the game will be hemorrhaging players in the endgame.\n\n- Trade. I don't really need to say more.\n\n- Frankly, my main problem with all those issues is that most of them have already been dealt with in poe1. That's what make is so infuriating.\n\nAtm I would give poe2 a 9/10 for visuals, sound effects, etc. But a 4/10 for system design.

I really do, but the nerfs that are being applied are down right retarded. I have a ranger with Escape Shot. I got it because it has a high freeze chance and you do cool ass flip maneuver. THE SKILL ITSELF tells you that its not meant for damage, rather it's freeze effect. Well now that ice has a global debuff now Escape Shot not only still sucks ass for damage, but now it doesn't even do what it was intended to do, which is QUICKLY FREEZE ENEMIES! The skill is WORTHLESS! Which sucks ass because the skill was so cool and fun to use! I literally deleted the skill gem once I saw how hard they dicked on ice. I should feel like a god while i'm playing this game. It's the whole damn point! I'm fighting hordes of demons and shit that can 1-hit me and you're telling me after spending 30hrs building my ice move up to be able to walk through the crowds and feel like a complete baddass, i just straight up can't anymore because some dipshit on twitch or youtube streamed themselves with a broken character that THEY SPECED TO BE BROKEN and then complain that they do too much damage is fucking absurd! Oh you're broken character that you specifically made to be broken is too powerful? Oh man poor you....suck my dick. Get out of my face, you piece of shit you ruined it for everyone else. That's like playing DMC and complaining that Dante does too many combos...\"duhh it was too cool and i'm dumb and retarded, so nurff it please, i'm a streamer duh hurr durr.\" and like the Lightning debuff that happened, what, the 16th of Dec? Devs... WHY IN THE FUCK would you nerf lighting and then simultaneously add nodes to the passive skill tree for more lighting damage/effect?? Who needs to be fired for making a brain crippling thought like that? What sense does that make? And I don't even want to hear, \"Oh well actually, it's only electrocute that's nerfed.\" Shut up. Just don't. You're doing more damage if you incorporate the new nodes! Don't even try to make that argument. Lightning is freakishly overpowered to begin with. Or like the charges you get. Power, frenzy and endurance. You have like 6 fucking ways to generate a power charge, while frenzy and endurance have only 2. Frenzy is BIG DICKED ON. Pin, in my opinion barley fuckin works. so you can't really generate a frenzy charge using pin with Combat Frenzy. ALSO since ice is nerfed. you have a reduced chance to generate frenzy charges because it works off of freeze build up, which you guessed it, is the one thing they nerfed most with ice, leaving lighting. look, i like lighting, but this is path of exiles, not path of lighting. EVERYONE is on the lighting bandwagon! I wanna be different. The passive skill tree is complex and gigantic specifically so you can make the super cool builds, the painstakingly really shitty builds, the stupid fun for a few minutes and the novelty wears off builds. That's what it's about! You can build a warrior to basically be a mage. is it gonna be good? maybe not, but you can do it! My hand is being forced to play lightning at this point and I hate it. Oh, and the fact that endurance and power charges can be generated at such a higher rate than frenzy is stupid. Why can I just generate a power charge pretty much whenever I the fuck I want but frenzy...I can only gain every 5secs. if i'm in a party and and we're getting swarmed, I NEED FRENZY CHARGES. bam bam bam, pin, freeze, crit, badaboom badabing frenzy charges, now I can come in and explode the swarming horde with poison gass explosions! I saved the day! No wipe, no reset, everyone praises me, we move on. WRONG! I can't! I can only gain a frenzy charge every 5secs and top of that I can barely build pin or freeze to generate a charge to begin with, let alone gain one every 5secs. Like Devs... come on! Endurance charges are, I'm not gonna lie I only looked into way to generate endurance. I don't know how good or bad they are, but power? Oh boy... Power steals the fucking show. You can practically generate a power charge whenever the hell you want! I'm not saying you need to nerf lightning or power charges. I'm saying devs, when it come to the things you're looking at nerfing, you seriously need to consider WHY they're able to just walk through enemies. Have people send pics of there passive skill trees with their complaints. ex. if i have like 400% freeze build-up. You best believe i'm expecting to walk through enemies! 4x normal freeze build-up? Yes, 100% I should be walking through enemies. That makes sense. If you have -20% fire res and I deal 200% fire damage, you should be FUCKING ANNIHILATED, not sort of burning and still coming at me like I didn't do anything to you. That's exactly how ice feels now. it sucks! Look, I know this game is still early access and ya'll have been working hard to fix shit. Like the first 3 days of the game being out you fixed the dodge rolling problem and now we can roll through enemies. That's godsend! THAT'S the shit we want! That's good shit! Take away the nerfs. They're hindering the game and tailoring my game-play experience to what's left, what you guys didn't nerf. I wanna play my way. I don't want to be the 100,000th lightning monk. That's lame. My point is, you're making my lvl 42 feel like a lvl 15. That makes me not want to play your game. I felt bad typing that out, but it needed to be said. Lastly, not being able to use my early access character when the game fully releases is sooooooooo FUCKING STUPID! PLENTY of games devs have enabled you to bring your early access character from early access to main game. Multiple companies have done this. Saying that the early access characters will be stuck in an early access 'league' because of balancing and some other bullshit excuse. Is simply that, bullshit. If you can rework and re-balance the game right now in early access, then why even make a whole  ass different league when the game fully releases called, standard league. Why not just keep reworking and re-balancing off of early access and make the early access build into you're full release build. I'm not a developer, so I don't know how hard that is, but if games like RuneScape can switch GAME ENGINES and you still keep your character and items earned and they did this 2 times! Back in what was it 04-05 when rs became rs2, and then 08-09 when rs2 became rs3? You're telling me a company 20yrs ago can accomplish that but you guys can't even bring my character from early access to main game?

What's even better after you've slain the BBB (Big Bad Boss) you get to feel your dopamine burst into fireworks with colour just like the pretty little volcanic rainbows of colourful loot that burst out of the enemy at the end to celebrate your tough victory, which help you get better gear and progress through the game further. I would advise watching some earlier beginner tutorial guides on YouTube to help understand the games mechanics with upgrading gear and what to focus on in the early game but this is a great game to be enjoyed.", "timestamp_created": 1734975677, "timestamp_updated": 1734975677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183497144": {"recommendationid": "183497144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050642133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3310, "playtime_at_review": 3084, "last_played": 1735054299}, "language": "english", "review": "Best diablo game we never got", "timestamp_created": 1734975575, "timestamp_updated": 1734975575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183497122": {"recommendationid": "183497122", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996089801", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4673, "playtime_at_review": 7469, "last_played": 1734975294}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been almost 3 weeks since the release and it's still unplayable.

While there are moments of greatness, significant flaws hold the game back from being truly enjoyable in the long run.\n\nPros:\n\nAnimations are fluid and visually impressive, adding a sense of polish to combat and abilities. Same with effects and graphics in general\u2014the world of the game is visually appealing, with a great atmosphere that does it job to immerse players into the dark fantasy world of POE.\n\nThe 3-Act campaign is well-crafted, enjoyable, and easily the most rewarding part of the game.\n\nCons:\n\nThe endgame balance is where the cracks start to show. Issues like frustrating drop rates, uneven mob scaling in maps, and narrow build viability make progression feel tedious rather than rewarding.\n\nOn-death effects add unnecessary frustration, punishing players in ways that feel unfair and unfun.\n\nThe trials (Sekhemas and Chaos) are overly punishing. The mechanics lack inspiration and offer little room for meaningful counterplay. The RNG itself is too punishing\u2014if you get unlucky with debuffs, you can outright lose the trial through no fault of your own. For example, getting a movement speed debuff often leaves you as good as screwed, no matter how well you\u2019ve prepared. I think it can be easily improved by adding more links between room choices in Sekhemas and more debuff choices in Chaos and making debuffs less punishing at least in early stages.\n\nSimilarly, the Atlas system feels like a battle against RNG rather than a test of skill or preparation, punishing players regardless of their gear or build. The endgame allows little to no creativity in build crafting. The game is so punishing that players are forced to build around strict defensive caps just to survive. For example, you have to push resistances, but even then, you can still be one-shot by an absurd \"on death\" mechanic from a random white mob. Survivability becomes mandatory, leaving players no choice but to roll defenses on every single piece of gear. The game is just unplayable otherwise.\n\n*Kripparian\u2019s video \"Path of Exile 2 is Ruthless\" captures these issues perfectly. The endgame systems feel needlessly harsh and punishing.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI\u2019ve pushed to tier 12 maps and realized that the game simply stopped being fun and enjoyable at some point. I\u2019ll happily change my review to positive if Grinding Gear Games addresses these glaring problems. But as it stands, I can\u2019t recommend this game based on its current state, nor am I willing to overlook its flaws simply because it\u2019s \"better than Diablo 4.\" Being better than a bad game is hardly an achievement, and Path of Exile 2 should aim much higher.", "timestamp_created": 1734797524, "timestamp_updated": 1734798419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679907739162445068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182834452": {"recommendationid": "182834452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129056320", "num_games_owned": 1134, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 12976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9609, "playtime_at_review": 7198, "last_played": 1735059182}, "language": "english", "review": "Path of Exile 2 Early Access has been an incredible experience, delivering the challenging gameplay and scarce loot drops I was hoping for.

The environments feel richer, darker, and more immersive\u2014like walking through a gothic art museum, if the paintings occasionally tried to stab you.\n\nGameplay: Compared to games such as Diablo 4, Path of Exile 1, and Last Epoch, gameplay feels slower but deliberate and strategic. The weighty animations and responsive controls make each encounter satisfying, rewarding careful planning over button-mashing.\n\nCombat: Skill gems have been reworked, offering greater flexibility in customizing characters and creating devastating combos. Players can experiment with setups to suit different playstyles. Bosses are like Dark Souls\u2014challenging but incredibly rewarding to defeat after a few tries. One moment you're a mighty champion; the next, you're questioning your life choices.\n\nClasses: Having tried both the Witch and Warrior, melee classes currently feel weaker in terms of survivability compared to ranged classes. This imbalance needs attention from developers to ensure all playstyles are viable and rewarding. Playing melee sometimes feels like hugging a cactus\u2014brave, painful, and questionably effective.\n\nEndgame: The endgame starts strong with exciting boss fights and map-based challenges that test your builds and strategies. However, the limited variety of encounters and repetitive grinding for loot can make it feel stale over time. As this is still early access, I hope future updates bring more content\u2014like unique bosses, dynamic events, or progression systems\u2014to keep things fresh.\n\nConclusion: Path of Exile 2 is an impressive evolution of the ARPG genre. It keeps the depth and complexity fans love while modernizing visuals and mechanics. The slower pace may not suit everyone, melee class balancing needs work, and the endgame could use more variety. Despite these issues, its foundation is strong, and future updates should only make it better. \n\nScore: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1734873844, "timestamp_updated": 1734873844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670712113380432129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183256806": {"recommendationid": "183256806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183603973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1734728986}, "language": "english", "review": "As a first-time player, Path of Exile 2 felt less like a game and more like a test of patience.

Naturally, I cycled through a bunch of different classes, took some extended coffee breaks (read: months), and came back as clueless as ever. Long story short, I am, from my perspective, still a certified noob while playing both games. Sure, my wins early on, here, felt somewhat like actual wins, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the game is secretly prepping me for failure all over again.\n\nAnd oh, what wasn\u2019t I wrong about that!\n\nFast forward to Path of Exile 2. I hit a wall midway through Act 1 with my first character. Naturally, I chose the same class I played in the original game. True to form, I ignored every single warning sign, like a signaler on an airfield, that I was completely botching my build. This led to a character that couldn\u2019t even take down the King in the Mist. Many wasted uncut gems and support gems later, the cost of fixing my mistakes were greater than my entire retirement plan. In the end, I did what any self-respecting gamer would do: I rerolled and Googled [url=https://deltiasgaming.com/a-comprehensive-guide-about-the-witch-class-in-path-of-exile-2/] Witch Class for Dummies [/url], and got offered the holy grail, [url=https://maxroll.gg/poe2/build-guides/minion-army-infernalist-leveling-guide#skills-header] the Infernalist minion build [/url], which looked like the magical path for Act 1 to 3, or at least, that is what I thought!\n\nHoping this time I wouldn\u2019t end up with a character that needs an exorcist, I dove back in and climbed my way up, passing through the areas I had previously flailed around in. I Finally reached Freythorn once again killing the mobs here with ease, and, to my absolute delight, managed to kill the bastard that previously kept crushing my sanity into oblivion fairly fast.\n\nPushing further into The Ogham areas, I noticed the difficulty spike once again. Near the end, it seemed like I was trapped in a personal torture chamber, and the Executioner definitely felt like he was auditioning to be my lifelong nemesis. What felt like an eternal struggle, I learned that I had to tweak my build a bit better, and he finally dropped dead. To my surprise, he left me my very first spirit gem. I used it to craft my Raging Spirit skill, and suddenly the game stopped bullying me, at least for now. It finally seemed like I had made a good choice with this build.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, I was finally upgrading from clueless newbie to a real Exile.\n\nOr maybe not, not just yet! Stepping into Ogham Manor was like entering a haunted house where the ghosts didn\u2019t just jump-scare me, they burned my resources and kept me busy for a while. The guide I was following? Yeah, turns out it was more of a polite suggestion than the bulletproof strategy I thought it was. At first, everything was peachy; I was smashing mobs left and right, feeling like a legend. But then, this area decided to take things to another level.\n\nThe mobs got angrier, swarming me like mosquitoes at a camping trip. They rushed me, shoved me around, interrupted my spells, and just when I thought I could escape, BOOM! I was blown to smithereens. One mob exploded, another yanked the rug out from under me, and before I knew it, I was sprawled on the floor, defeated by regular mobs, hah, what a joke right?\n\nMoving onward, I shuffled in and out of the manor to offload my loot that seemed to multiply like rabbits! Finally, I reached The Mad Wolf. He wasn\u2019t here to play fetch. It was a wake-up call that the gloves were off. Either I stuck it out or admitted defeat with my tail between my legs.\n\nWhat followed was a parade of deaths so ridiculous it could\u2019ve been its own blooper reel. I tinkered endlessly with my gem skills, fine-tuned my gear with whatever scraps I had, and squinted at the boss mechanics like I was cramming for an exam. Every defeat nudged me a little closer, teaching me something new, like the fact that this wolf really hated me.\n\nAnd then, finally, sweet victory! The boss fell to my last desperate blow, leaving me in a state of disbelief, as if I\u2019d just stumbled upon a hidden treasure of everlasting glory.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say the game is impossible, but it definitely has a \u201cmess up and prepare to be roasted\u201d vibe. It\u2019s like the game\u2019s saying, \u201cYou think you\u2019ve got this? Watch me teach you humility!\u201d While not everything is spoon-fed to you, there\u2019s a whole community ready to hand you a metaphorical cup of coffee and help you figure out your build. You stumble, you adapt, and eventually, you\u2019ll reach the point where you will be winning your fights. \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the kind of challenge I expect from every game I play!\n\n\ud83d\udcdc SIDE NOTES:\n\n[code][b]\u2b50 For me the WASD and the added roll/dodge were a must for me to pull me into this genre.\n\u2b50 Positioning, and reactive reflexes are very important, without them you will surely die!!\n\u2b50 The lack of in depth knowledge en understanding boosts community interaction. ...\n\u2b50 Visuals and voice acting are from the highest quality, they nailed it in this game.\n\nI never expected myself to enjoy this type of game, but the Early Access drew me right in![/b] [/code]\n[code][b]\u26a0\ufe0f While I believe this game is more accessible to a larger audience, it may still not be for everyone, particularly due to its steep difficulty, challenging learning curve, and significant time investment required.

Tbh i thought Last epoch was the best one after diablo 4, but  PoE2 put both games in their knees and easily at that, without any shred of effort too. The game has bad traits, but the good traits surpass by a long stretch. \n\n[h2] Armor stuff/cosmetic [/h2]\nI beat diablo 4 in gamepass, something which was atrocious to me, was the battlepass locked the good cosmetic and so on, and normal clothes looked dogshit until the point you beat lilith, they still looked like that.  In path of exile, i'm playing as monk and quickly i was able to test a bunch of different drips. AND you can equip mixed armors traits, like EVASION/ARMOR/ENERGY SHIELD you name it.  This makes building your character really diverse both in good looks + good build for YOUR playstyle, isn't something set on stone. \n\n\n\n[h2] Skill tree, IS ONE OF BEST AND ONE OF WORST ONES. [/h2]\nI mean, if you keep and follow the path you want, it's really good, i was testing a fast casting skill system, and it's working like i wanted, a fast paced monk melee.  Yet if you're a beginner to the genre, and dont know what you're up to. It's annoying,[edit] you can actually can respec after some hours of progress, but the respec system is expensive... and with thousands of skills this can be a problem.  Thefore it culls beginners and jelly brains, but i dont think it's really really bad,  if anything they're sticking to a Niche and this actually makes a better experience than the washed experience we had in a Diablo 4.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nLiterally fire, i dunno if they're gonna add more difficulty sliders or whatever, but as it's rn, it's intense, after we go to red veil map i think, i noticed the enemies mobs started having better tactics, ranged, poison,  fast and slow ones and stuff like that, my point here, is neither their life or mine was bigger, so they did a avg damage and  died quickly, i did high damage and got damaged quickly too.  A really fair balance if you ask  me,  the bosses aren't spongyyy they just can do a LOT of damage, but somewhat lives under 1-2 min at most.  This made me have a really better time than in Diablo 4, anyone who tried to play the highest difficulty settings, starts noticing the game fights are stretched, they become really spongy and it's tiresome after some point, plus blizzard nerfed the shit out of a lot of skills, so isn't rewarding to actually keep playing the game to be punished. (obviously i cant use this same judgement to a released game, but i noticed at least with monkey skill kit, the way i was playing was basically charging stacks to unleash more powerful ones, it's a really technical build, HIGH DAMAGE with timed properly, and if somehow you screw, you can die with 1-3 hits, depends of enemy kind. So i really enjoyed the danger-reward payout. \n\nI noticed in the early maps, but something which really stuck out for me was the designs of enemies were really unique and flashed, hardly a simple reskin, at least in the first 7 regions, so in theory ... the rest stays like this, it's a really good thing to see the effort put into something you like, so we the players, have a better experience. \n\n[h2] Graphics/Performance [/h2]\nTbh game graphics look really good for an isometric, optimization is great in everything but SHADOWS, idk i mean i tested everything ultra-high and stuff, but when you change Shadows from Low to high,  i got 120fps(OK, playing with it like that), but if you change to Ultra i got 80fps... like 40 fps loss, from low to high it only ate 140 to 124... so xD for being an isometric i dont think shadows are THAT important, but anyway, i can notice the difference of three presets, thus i play in high with 120fps and everything else maxed.  (I use rtx 4070ti super)\n\nNot graphics per se, but the servers are so damn fine, my ping stays between 7-12 playing in SAO PAULO SA. Really, really happy with this, i'm used to online games staying at around 27-40, and i have a good internet but most servers we have on SA are usually bad, so that made me happy :D .\n\n\n[h2] Worse negativity trait [/h2]\nErr i think the game lacks a sell/stack sell and other QoL features, to handle inventory. I tried it around, but i can only use stash/vendors with drag and drop, DRAG AND DROP IN THIS DAY AND AGE IS BOTHERSOME. Def i look forward to this change, because you can get inventory full in 10min or so, and then you need to go back, and drag drop 9 stuff, rinse repeat that under an 1h, it becomes annoying FAST \n\nYou shouldnt get used to having only one char for long in PoE universe, friendly reminder.\n\nThe MTX of PoE2 a bit too much expensive,  to buy a single cloth in this game, and if you got preorder you got like 300 points... simple even if you buy the cheapest MTX+what they \"give to you\" you can't buy a single cloth, and the cheapest option it's 5$ no region priced...that is errr hmm, i mean i personally wont pay the price of a new game in a skin, no matter how good it look like xD", "timestamp_created": 1734390863, "timestamp_updated": 1734448934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 167, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651243388652801514", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182855673": {"recommendationid": "182855673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081578475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3950, "playtime_at_review": 1371, "last_played": 1735036661}, "language": "english", "review": "As it stands, this game isn't worth the effort - it's an exercise in frustration. They need to seriously work on the tuning of early content and the design of the bosses. Giving a roll isn't an excuse to make bosses have completely arbitrary one shot mechanics with poor telegraphing. The game is also missing some key features like being able to turn off the auto-aim which is horrid when you need to actually aim your skills. Enemies also desperately need to stop glitch-moving your character with some attacks (bosses/charging enemies). It looks off and feels incredibly awkward.\n\nThey've upped the visual quality and the bosses in particular feel better minus the one shots. I'm not convinced the new, slower direction is actually better for the majority of the content though. It simply takes longer which gives the impression of being more engaging than it really is. It's not like you're utilizing different tools in unique situations, it's just using everything you have for every kill which gets tedious.\n\nHope the game gets better. A fresh take on PoE is a lovely prospect.\n\nEDIT: \nAfter a few more boss experiences, I take back bosses feeling better. They have some truly boring time-wasting designs be it just obnoxious HP pools and/or excessive periods of not taking damage. Act 2's boss first phase is a wonderful example of terrible conveyance, not being clear what's happening during the sandstorm. Not only does the offscreen NPC generate a shield with no cue, the mobs leave an impossible-to-see burn on the ground when killed making it unclear how you're dying unless you wait for the sandstorm to finish before respawning and actually have a chance of seeing the visual. \n\nIt's unfortunate, but in the first 20 hours, the best case is the game being a little boring, failing to capture the fun of the first game. In the worst, it's just an unsatisfying slog.\n\nEdit 2:\nHaving done yet more content out of some absurd notion that the game would get better, my opinion has continued to sour. I am now convinced the team behind the game have an incredibly skewed vision that fundamentally misses what makes these games fun. This is essentially what Dark Souls 2 was to that series. It's not challenging, it's not engaging, it's simply bad. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the absolute worst experience I've had with an ARPG. Early access isn't an excuse here - the design choices made honestly feel like the developers hate their players. I genuinely hope they'll eventually pull their heads out of their asses and focus on adding fun to the game rather than poorly made \"challenge.\"", "timestamp_created": 1734304576, "timestamp_updated": 1734492646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595181107521057129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183356831": {"recommendationid": "183356831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030205251", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1782, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1735060537}, "language": "english", "review": "For those who have trouble with the early access key (bought on steam), just launch the game, click create account and type in your name, close game and wait 5-10min (I guess the game need to verify with the server or something) launch the game and watch at the bottom left corner for authentication and try to login, this should work for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1734851362, "timestamp_updated": 1734851362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59051978588104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183058493": {"recommendationid": "183058493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125040437", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2968, "playtime_at_review": 2750, "last_played": 1734654884}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is good but runs like shit on some systems.

WASD movement feels great. Not much to say\r\n2. Skill combos are pretty fun compared to one-button-builds that were very prevalent in the first game.\r\n3. The classes have a lot of personality and their voice lines are a lot better than most of the characters' comments about the story in the first game.\r\n4. Sockets are on skills themselves and not on gear. This removes a lot of socket pressure and instead shifts it into support location pressure.\r\n4a. Tangentially related and kind of a +/- for some, support gems are all 1-of-a-kind. Each can only have a single copy in your build across all equipped skills. I actually like this because most supports are about utility and not their damage, but it's a big shift from how you think about them coming from PoE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bad:\r\n1. Mapping is absolutely awful. Each zone has a single life available, and random deaths are just as bad as before if not worse due to poor visibility and bad telegraphs. Because movement is so heavily limited it's significantly harder to get out of bad situations. This slows the gameplay to a crawl in the vast majority of situations or turns everything into \"kill or be killed\" to an even higher degree than PoE was.\r\n2. Sanctum is fucking terrible as an ascension mechanic. It was fine as an optional piece of content for people that enjoyed it but being forced on everyone is atrocious. If you look up tips for how to handle it, 90% of guides will tell you to overlevel the content to the point that you trivialize it. When the optimal strategy is to effectively nullify the content, that is TERRIBLE game design.\r\n3. The end game league content is effectively copy-pasted with very very minor changes to adjust for PoE2. They're still just as rippy as before which makes them feel awful when you go back to point 1 and realize that you only have a single life per map. Most of them are better off ignored until you're 1000% certain your build can survive them, let alone *clear* them.\r\n4. Respecs and crafting currencies were touted as being super accessible during campaign. Both of these things are a lie. By the time you can feel the need for a respec, around act 2(cruel), items aren't plentiful enough nor do they sell for enough gold to realistically be able to afford a respec in a reasonable timeframe. If your build is struggling it can easily take hours just to course-correct and be able to enjoy yourself again. Crafting currency doesn't drop nearly enough during the campaign in order to be able to actually use it. You're better off hoping for a good drop and saving the currency to buy something later.\r\n5. On the topic of crafting, it's literally all RNG and hope for the best right now. There aren't any equivalent crafting options to old chaos orbs or alterations, and there's no scouring orbs to reset an item and try again.

Every step is based on RNG. \nExample of the joys getting the gear you need: have an item you think is the best thing you have found thus far? Use a vaal orb for a chance at another stat on it! Oh wow, every single stat you previously rolled has now been changed and the item is utter trash. It's corrupted now and you can't change anything about it. The end. \n\nTLDR, game's combat is great, but progress is gated behind casino logic and huge time investments.

But the devs attitude makes this game too niche for me to recommend this openly on steam.  I have been able to get through the content but thinking back, it just this pattern: manageable difficulty while you figure things out, then you get a groove and start having fun, then you hit a wall hard.  Then you bang you head on a wall, pour salt in your eyes, and take a stroll down the seventh layer of hell until you get past the wall.  Then you rinse and repeat over and over again.  The worst part is the ability to upgrade your gear is incredibly scarce, and when you have the ability to do it - its all gambling on whether it will be the modifiers you need/want.  \n\nThere are plenty of gamers who want a punishing game - what they always fail to understand is that they are a small representation of the population.  Why GGG refuses to have difficulty levels and why they think the original campaign needs to be so punishing I don't know.  And fine - feel free to read this and think \"git gud\".  But why take all the incredible game play they have here and gatekeep it behind asininely difficult walls of boss fights just peppered throughout - I don't know what type of gamer elitism fuels this but its gross.  \n\nI don't get a sense of accomplishment overcoming these walls.... I get relief its over and I can continue with the GD game. The class combinations and combat is awesome - but boss encounters where 90% of the fight is dodge rolling isn't fun especially when you make everything split second reaction times.  Oh but the rest of the game is much slower and all about setting up and strategy.  There is just a huge disconnect - but the \"in crowd\" call these \"gear checks\" or \"build checks\" or whatever.  \n\nThere is a lot of good here but overall its another game that artificially reduces its player population potential by some ideology that matters to a single digit percentage of the gaming populace.

When it works, it\u2019s a fantastic experience, and I\u2019ve played as much as I could despite major technical issues. Unfortunately, I feel compelled to warn others about a critical, long-standing bug that severely affects the game\u2019s playability.\n\nSince launch, the game has suffered from a serious issue that freezes PCs entirely, forcing a hard reset. This problem doesn\u2019t discriminate between setups\u2014it\u2019s affecting powerful, high-end rigs as well as more modest systems. There are even reports from users claiming their PCs have been permanently damaged (\u201cbricked\u201d) due to these crashes.\n\nIn my case, I\u2019ve endured multiple hard resets and even reinstalled Windows twice, thinking the forced shutdowns might have corrupted my system data. After all this frustration, I can no longer stay silent.\n\nWhat\u2019s equally disappointing is the lack of communication from the developers. Despite two forum threads with over 250 pages of user reports and discussions, there\u2019s been no update or acknowledgment from the team for more than two weeks. This silence feels unacceptable given the severity of the issue and the number of players unable to enjoy the game.\n\nI\u2019m leaving this review as a warning to potential players: proceed with caution. While the game itself is excellent, the risk of encountering this critical error is significant, and the lack of response from the developers adds to the frustration.

I should like this game, but I can't because of the game itself and some extremely strange design decisions. For context, they flipped my original issues with POE 1, where I thought the gem and currency systems were too bloated and complicated but the gameplay, once you parsed through, was fun. Now the systems are clean and understandable (even if there're still too many currencies) but the gameplay is so. Unbearably. Boring. \n\n- Update: So, I still want to like the game and so I'm watching updates and giving it retries. I don't know how I forgot this, but there's a crashing issue that hasn't been addressed by GGG. Whenever I load there's a pretty good chance it's gonna crash my computer. Not just the game, no, the whole computer locks and freezes and can't be used until I hard reset. If they would mention it, I wouldn't be as pissed, but I've reached out, seen others reach out, and they're just not talking about it. I went back to try and see if the checkpoint update alleviates how slow and boring the game is, but I didn't get a chance to try because it crashed my PC. I'm getting to a point where I'd say fuck GGG and fuck this game. \n\n- They give you massive maps to explore with bosses and zones off the beaten path for loot, but the issue is that your character is just slow. They walk like they've never needed to do anything in their life and if you clear one side of the map, enjoy the multi-minute walk back to the other side.\n\n- Loot feels awful. I rarely saw rares get dropped and I saw so many pieces for classes that weren't my own that a lot of the time that was what had filled my inventory. I never got a better belt or hands, or helmet, so I just never changed them. On top of that some of the currencies are what you need to enhance your skills and I didn't see some of them a single time.\n\n- The inventory is ridiculously small and playing Tetris with it is not fun, actually. You'll be exploring then end up having to run back every ten minutes so you can sell or salvage stuff. \n\n- The game IS in EA, but there's an error that can cause your whole PC to just freeze up any time you see a loading screen. As in you have to hard reset it. I tried to reach out to them about it, but at the time of this writing they haven't addressed the issue and they had no help for me when I hit up support. I've had friends dealing with this and I've seen people on their Discord mention it. \n\n- They tout that their controller support is amazing, and I will say that they did a good job there, but it's not complete. Your overlay map cannot be moved if you're on controller, which exacerbates the issue of the massive maps. It's really disheartening to try and go somewhere on the map that you can't see only to find that you cleared it, but it was off the map and you couldn't pan over. Also, in the Ascensions, if you die, there's no button to move on, you just get stuck on the \"You Died\" screen.\n\n- The MTX is wild. I respect that the game is F2P, or will be, and that you don't have to buy the stuff, but 35-40 USD was the CHEAPEST armor set in the store, and the in game armor is well made and looks good... but it's ugly as sin. Of the few legendaries I got (that were actually for my class) they didn't look at all unique, just another fantasy jacket or whatever.\n\n- Nerfs! Again, they're in EA, they have to balance, but they're wrecking builds and not compensating for a respect for people effected. That sucks. They said it's EA, these characters won't be on 1.0, so why not offer respec tokens? This is some questionable \"unfun decision making\" like Remnant II and early days of Diablo IV.\n\n- To whatever genius decided to lock you out of using KBM if you're on controller in the character select or vice versa... why? What is the benefit of that? ESPECIALLY when you're missing mapping and controls on controller. What if someone wants to controller for the gameplay then KBM for the menus? Who does that help?\n\nIf I could refund the game, I would. I don't think it's a fun game, systemically interesting and pretty, but it's not fun.

So I put over 80 hours since the game dropped and here is way I don't recommend it in its current state;\n\n- Difficulty: Initially I didn't mind the difficulty of the game. I was hoping it starts off really difficult with powerful bosses, but as you progress, the game will reward your efforts of farming and character development by making the game easier as you gain skills. That's not the case. No matter how much you progress, no matter how well you build your character, the game stays sweaty af. Doable, but sweaty. It's all well for a Dark souls game to be difficult, but how many of us keep playing Dark Souls for months on end? This is not dark souls, stop treating it like it is. I want to replay this game over and over again with different characters and experiment with different builds. I definitely don't want to replay it over and over again when the game is this difficult.\n\n- Loot; wtf is going on with the loot??? You barely see any rare drops, let alone unique drops, but that would be okay. I explained to myself that the game is trying to encourage us to use the crafting mechanics to create our own equipment and that would be somewhat acceptable (albeit very lazy from the development side,) except - get this - THERE ARE BARELY ANY CURRENCY DROPS. I am at level 70 and I have to grind hours in the endgame for a single exalted orb. In 80+ hours I didn't manage to get a single chance orb. So you don't get equipment drops, but cannot craft either and just keep sweating trying to farm non existing crafting currencies. Why would they do that? Why would *I* do that??\n\n- Endgame content; Okay. You soldiered through 6 acts. Your neck hurts from being tense just trying not to die through every single damned map. no matter how good you are, some clown will explode on death and that's you one shot dead. Or blow up corpses under your feet from 20 meters away and you will literally never see it coming. There is nothing you can do about it either, because I have 60% evasion and shocked enemies get blinded AND maimed and I have 100% chance to shock, but somehow these blinded and maimed enemies can hit me with ranged weapons about 50% of the time... With 60% evasion. Someone please work that out for me, because I can't. So anyways... You soldiered through just trying to get to the endgame content where you can have fun, but nope. It gets worse. You open the portal(S) to your desired map, 6 gates open, but when you die - get this- YOU CANNOT GO BACK, LOSE THE MAP AAAANNNDDDD LOSE XP AS WELL. I mean this is just salt in the wound, a spit in the face of the gamer.\n\nI am done with this. Hey Devs, I doubt you'll read this, but if you do... Do you know how many hours I played with POE 1? almost 1000. Do you know how many hours I played with Dark souls? less than 100. Just saying. if it ain't broke... why did you just break it? For anyone who says \"bUt tHIs iS jUsT EaRLy AcCesS\" shut up. I don't want to hear it. Early access is not beta. We paid money for this, we're not f****ng game testers, they get paid. We are paying customers who want to play a functioning, enjoyable game, this is not that. For anyone else who says, \"gIt gOoD\" you know where to go. You are in the wrong genre, the wrong game, take your DS bs back to where it belongs. ARPGs are there to have you feel overpowered with a good build because that is literally the reward for your grind!! Your power is your reward and that was taken away, so now it's just a sweaty game that sh*ts on you whenever it can. Definitely avoid if you're new to the genre but also avoid if you're a POE 1 fan. You'll be bitterly dissappointed and if you aren't... If you say you enjoy the difficulties and the stingy drops etc. you're either lying, trolling or there is something wrong with you.\n\nUpdate: 2 out of 3 maps also crashes the game.

Otherwise, the full release will likely be better if you wait.\n\nCampaign is solid and what we have currently makes me excited for the rest.\nMoment to moment gameplay is engaging and feels really good, WASD movement is fantastic and I'm surprised it took this long, hoping that gets adopted by other games in the genre going forward. Pausing is an awesome feature too.\nBalancing aside as it's only a week in, but build variety is looking good. Many options for each class, with many variations between them with the subclasses. Really excited for all the options when we have all the classes out.\nBUT.\nIt is readily apparent that they pivoted to push endgame out the door for EA.\nIt just isn't very fun, mostly because it's PoE 1 design in a game trying to distance itself from that.\nBy the time you hit endgame it's back to blasting the whole map with a single ability, instantly killing everything and everything instantly killing you. Modifiers like burning ground are unfun, sometimes hardly visible, and they couldn't forget to bring back mobs exploding on death for added random one shots. Which just makes the whole one life per map thing way too punishing, and for co-op especially is a kick in the teeth since revive gets disabled.\nAnd the ascendancy trials. Holy fucking shit.\nWhoever thought that SANCTUM and ULTIMATUM should be the replacements for Labyrinth is a lunatic who needs to locked up. Aside from being horrible content, the balancing on these two modes is atrocious. When the community's only solution to people not being able to complete either of these two modes is \"just overlevel it\" then clearly it isn't well designed.\nThe problem only gets worse in endgame. Getting one attempt at a boss who can 2-3 shot your honor bar in sanctum, especially after having just ran the rest of the dungeon for 20 minutes is infuriating. Players 10, 15 even 20 levels above may not be able to complete the trials needed for their ascendancy points, made even worse by the atrocious drop rates for these tokens making it hard to even attempt the trials.\nThe way the game is currently, I'd rather just make a new character and build than play anything past level 70 at this point.\nWhile I'm glad that endgame is already here so that feedback can be provided and the systems improved, jeez, what a rough first draft.\n\nIs it gonna get better? I have almost no doubt that it will. GGG can be stubborn about some design choices but at the end of the day they clearly want to make something that can be enjoyed.\nBut if you can stomach not being a part of the \"cool new thing\" for about a year, save yourself the trouble and wait.

It's not worth spending money for EA.  If you're going to play it, play a ranged character.  Melee is awful. \n\nI started with warrior and melee feels awful.  Almost all the skills have travel animation/repositioning, and in an ARPG where almost all the mobs are constantly zerging you using those skills can fuck you over.  What you end up with is auto-attacking most mobs until you can get some chain effect off of a stun.  Meanwhile you're stuck trying to stay on top of bosses/mobs to deal damage.  Bosses ability spam, so you're weaving in occasional auto attacks on them hoping to build a stun meter up enough to get a bit of a damage burst.   This sucks, and I don't have it in me to suffer through this low level play until some sort of usable kit emerges for the character.\n\nI switched to a necro and the difference between melee and ranged is absurd. I cleared the same amount of content in half the /played time with no deaths on the necro.  With melee I was averaging 1 death/level. \n\nI think the way I heard it best put is that if you're playing melee, you're playing a Souls game (without the Fromsoft magic).

(early access review) [/h1]\n\nFirst impressions: PoE 2 is very different from the first game as it's a lot slower and has a few different mechanics, one being the dodge roll. It masterfully combines challenging gameplay with incredible story depth, to create one of the most engaging action-RPG experiences available, in my opinion.\n\n[h2] Gameplay experience is amaaazing! [/h2] \nThe combat feels dynamic and skill-intensive, with additions like dodge-rolling and WASD support making battles thrilling and responsive. Unlike many ARPGs, a lot of the fights (vs all creatures, not just bosses) demands strategy, ESPECIALLY against challenging bosses with unique attack patterns. The gameplay is definitely a lot harder than POE 1.\n\n[h2] Diverse classes [/h2] \nEach class offers distinct playstyles\u2014from the agile Ranger dodging blows to the armour-clad Warrior charging into the fray, or the Witch commanding undead minions. This variety ensures replayability and caters to different player preferences.\n\n[h2] Customisable builds [/h2] \nWith its colossal skill trees, customisable gems that no longer require links, and layered progression systems, Path of Exile 2 rewards players who love fine-tuning their characters. The complexity might be daunting, but it\u2019s a paradise for those seeking ultimate optimisation.\n\n[h2] Immersive stories across the board [/h2] \nThough the story isn\u2019t necessarily groundbreaking, its world-building is compelling, with intriguing characters and cultures that enrich the journey. While loot can feel underwhelming at times (something GGG have acted upon by increasing specific drop rates), and the early-access structure makes progression slightly repetitive, these drawbacks are minor compared to the game's strengths.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1734139778, "timestamp_updated": 1734803582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182862104": {"recommendationid": "182862104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055471273", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 999, "playtime_at_review": 1636, "last_played": 1734973408}, "language": "english", "review": "Overtuned and frustrating.
