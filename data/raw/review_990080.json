Awkward to have Sebastian (a quest giver) at different places at the same time because you have multiple quests going on with him. Awkward to stumble upon places you visited many times, but this time it triggers some things when you get there because you're on a certain quest so this time you're character is like 'ahh so this must be that place she was talking about' as if you get there for the first time. Awkward to finish the main quest, have the ending ceremony and closure of the school year, then keep on going in the same time and place, meaning the school is still full of students and all npc's talk as if the school year isn't done yet. Awkward to suddenly have level-15 quests opening up while you're already at level 38 so the little challenge these quests are supposed to give is gone as well. \n\nBut having my own baby unicon chasing bubbles in my self-created/conjured little paradise is the cutest thing I'll ever see.", "timestamp_created": 1735051527, "timestamp_updated": 1735052102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183570939": {"recommendationid": "183570939", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991421919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 324, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1734984234}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this for 5 hours and I'm already bored out of my mind.

It truly feels like you're experiencing a story that happened in the Hogwarts castle about a century before the HP movies and books. Anybody that enjoys the series and doesn't mind some combat will have a blast with this game.\r\n\r\nThe combat in this game is pretty good and at times can feel almost souls-like. Lots of dodging and ability use during fights, but this opens up opportunities for combos which can be fun. Sometimes I find myself also wanting a melee option in a fight.\r\n\r\nThe broom flight can be clunky on a PC with mouse/keyboard controls. I have swapped to a controller during the broom trials and found a significant increase of control on the broom.\r\n\r\nI have a while to go in this game. This review might get updated once I finish if I have any additional thoughts.\r\n\r\n[h1] Objective Pro/Con[/h1]\r\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\r\n- Good performance for a game of its size. Running the game at ultra settings without ray tracing is great.\r\n\r\n- This game helps generate a fantastic understanding of the Hogwarts castle layout for those that struggle with following it via the description in the books or the views from the movies. I'd almost recommend this game based on this alone.\r\n\r\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\r\n- Ray tracing is a serious tax and improves the lighting in the game an unjustifiable amount for the performance penalty.\r\n\r\n- Game can sometimes be prone to crashing and spacial bugs that cause the player to get stuck in the falling animation. It generally autosaves frequently enough that this isn't that big of a deal.", "timestamp_created": 1735007020, "timestamp_updated": 1735007020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183529758": {"recommendationid": "183529758", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110578721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 4681, "last_played": 1735003096}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good!", "timestamp_created": 1735005464, "timestamp_updated": 1735005464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183528599": {"recommendationid": "183528599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399501024", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 303, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1735012136}, "language": "english", "review": "A Classic Long Game", "timestamp_created": 1735004085, "timestamp_updated": 1735004085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183528328": {"recommendationid": "183528328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450894159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 629, "playtime_at_review": 547, "last_played": 1735034511}, "language": "english", "review": "great", "timestamp_created": 1735003811, "timestamp_updated": 1735003811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183526927": {"recommendationid": "183526927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199806711219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1233, "playtime_at_review": 1279, "last_played": 1734998678}, "language": "english", "review": "Advantages:\r\n1.

Here are 2 videos that I used to obtain affordable FPS for this graphic intensive game if you ever have a more than 5 years old GPU card:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrMSn125PY\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0mWVLhy954&t=354s\r\n\r\n- To 100% achievement like I did over here, it's really not too bad, seriously. They do not have a 'Complete game with X difficulty'. It's really, doable. They do have things to collect, but its doable with plenty of guides online. \r\n\r\n- Side mission or main mission are more fun? To me, it's both. Character arcs and storyline + plot, it's really good. \r\n\r\n- Combat system, in my opinion, could be improved, parry system relies on the slow mo timer sorts and it's like super easy, like way too easy. You can also consider that the combat system is somewhat a hack and slash type of puddle. \r\n\r\n- Character power: now, many would argue, there's the easy path and there's the other path. Easy path would be using those dark arts powers while the other path involve using other skills. To me, character power on this game depends on how you wanna approach it, whether via using plants to fight / using complete stealth / potions. There's no right or wrong, I wanna 100% the game so using dark arts is the quickest solution to 1 tap kill enemies. However, if you would wanna try say, a combination of potion + plants, go ahead and try, no harm no foul. Again, there's also the element of the 'Ancient magic power', which is also OP in my opinion, but necessary, it's not as super OP as Avra Kadavra and it relies on your attacks on enemies and you have to collect the 'magic power'.\r\n\r\n- Story is pretty linear, which I'm neutral towards. Puzzles in the game are also quite fun and challenging\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Minus:  [/h1]\r\n\r\n- No nudity\r\n\r\n- Aside from the obvious GPU intensive answer, there's also the element of the storage. Well, typically for single player mode games, my RTX2060 SUPER + WD Black 2TB wouldn't struggle, but for this case this game eats up my hard disk. I honestly don't think WD Black is that sucks, but this game made it look like a kid. The saving time, loading time, cloud syncing time, is like total crap when you are using a hard disk instead of SSD to play this game. I honestly think that my PC suffered from BIOS/ startup issues just because I restarted my PC during when the game is downloading/ patching/ syncing\r\n\r\n- To grind for the achievement for those map collectibles are pretty boring, but there's no other choice, it's considerably easier to 100% this game compared to others that I have played in the past.\r\n\r\n- Bugs and crashes: yes I do sometimes encounter this and I do not think it has anything to do with my GPU / heating/ CPU, it could be the storage issues but I would think that this game do suffer from some optimization if you are coming from older cards\r\n\r\n- They did not have the time nor budget to add in a Quidditch game\r\n\r\n- As said above, this game needs SSD, don't know why but it needs it else suffer stuttering. Even I could run GTA 5 from HDD with minimal stutter during loadings\r\n\r\n- You have a skill called 'Revelio' which essentially is a 'Detective mode' and in my opinion, is necessary for the game, but it's mundane. I honestly wished they could have replaced or add on some other functions to act as a proxy for this Detective mode skill.\r\n\r\n[h1] What's fun:  [/h1]\r\n\r\n- Wingardium Leviosa\r\n- Avra Kadavra\r\n- Confringo\r\n- Incendio\r\n- Crucio\r\n- Accio\r\n\r\n[h1] CPU/ GPU Specs:  [/h1]\r\n\r\n- Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i9-9900 Processor\r\n- Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Buy/ Not buy ?:  [/h1]\r\n\r\n- If it's on sale, buy if you have a decent PC build, else avoid\r\n- Buy if you are into Harry Potter and its lore", "timestamp_created": 1734189395, "timestamp_updated": 1734189395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "182718618": {"recommendationid": "182718618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131001923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5332, "last_played": 1732722725}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story\nGreat game play\nThough I hope there are more kinds of AoE attack/defense", "timestamp_created": 1734175255, "timestamp_updated": 1734175255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, "183405500": {"recommendationid": "183405500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086779137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 957, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1735055751}, "language": "english", "review": "This is like Harry Potter-themed Skyrim... and I mean that in the best way!
